Visual Studio macos'ta çalışır mı? ->
.NET Core supports the previously mentioned operating systems as your development workstation. Visual Studio provides an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Windows and macOS. You can also use Visual Studio Code, which runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Visual Studio Code supports .NET Core, including IntelliSense and debugging. Most third-party editors, such as Sublime, Emacs, and VI, work with .NET Core. These third-party editors get editor IntelliSense using Omnisharp. You can also avoid any code editor and directly use the .NET Core CLI, available for all supported platforms.
