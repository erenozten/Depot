Overload / Method overloading  	(GITHUB)
overload nedir, overloading nedir, method overloading nedir

Method Overloading is the common way of implementing polymorphism. It is the ability to redefine a function in more than one form. A user can implement function overloading by defining two or more functions in a class sharing the same name. C# can distinguish the methods with different method signatures. i.e. the methods can have the same name but with different parameters list (i.e. the number of the parameters, order of the parameters, and data types of the parameters) within the same class.
•	Overloaded methods are differentiated based on the number and type of the parameters passed as arguments to the methods.
•	You can not define more than one method with the same name, Order and the type of the arguments. It would be compiler error.
•	The compiler does not consider the return type while differentiating the overloaded method. But you cannot declare two methods with the same signature and different return type. It will throw a compile-time error. If both methods have the same parameter types, but different return type, then it is not possible.
Why do we need Method Overloading ??
If we need to do the same kind of the operation in different ways i.e. for different inputs. In the example described below, we are doing the addition operation for different inputs. It is hard to find many different meaningful names for single action.
Different ways of doing overloading methods-
Method overloading can be done by changing:
1.	The number of parameters in two methods.
2.	The data types of the parameters of methods.
3.	The Order of the parameters of methods.


using System; 
class GFG { 
    // adding two integer values. 
    public int Add(int a, int b) 
    { 
        int sum = a + b; 
        return sum; 
    } 
  
    // adding three integer values. 
    public int Add(int a, int b, int c) 
    { 
        int sum = a + b + c; 
        return sum; 
    } 
  
    // Main Method 
    public static void Main(String[] args) 
    { 
        // Creating Object 
        GFG ob = new GFG(); 
        int sum1 = ob.Add(1, 2); 
        Console.WriteLine("sum of the two "
                          + "integer value : " + sum1); 
  
        int sum2 = ob.Add(1, 2, 3); 
        Console.WriteLine("sum of the three "
                          + "integer value : " + sum2); 
    } 
} 
Output:
sum of the two integer value : 3
sum of the three integer value : 6

    } 
}

Name : Akku, Id : 1
Name : Abby, Id : 2

What happens when method signature is same and the return type is different?
The compiler will give error as the return value alone is not sufficient for the compiler to figure out which function it has to call. Only if both methods have different parameter types (so, they have the different signature), then Method overloading is possible.

Example:

using System; 
class GFG { 
    // adding two integer value. 
    public int Add(int a, int b) 
    { 
  
        int sum = a + b; 
        return sum; 
    } 
  
    // adding three integer value. 
    public double Add(int a, int b) 
    { 
        double sum = a + b + 0.0; 
        return sum; 
    } 
  
    // Main Method 
    public static void Main(String[] args) 
    { 
        // Creating Object 
        GFG ob = new GFG(); 
  
        int sum1 = ob.Add(1, 2); 
        Console.WriteLine("sum of the two "
                          + "integer value :" + sum1); 
  
        int sum2 = ob.Add(1, 2); 
        Console.WriteLine("sum of the three "
                          + "integer value :" + sum2); 
    } 
} 
Compile Time Error:
prog.cs(15,19): error CS0111: A member `GFG.Add(int, int)’ is already defined. Rename this member or use different parameter types

integral type nedir, integral types nedir, Integral type nedir, Integral types nedir
Adına dikkat et zaten ne olduğu belli oluyor etimolojisinden: Integral -> Integer
The integral numeric types represent integer numbers. All integral numeric types are value types. They are also simple types and can be initialized with literals. All integral numeric types support arithmetic, bitwise logical, comparison, and equality operators.
Characteristics of the integral types
C# supports the following predefined integral types:
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INTEGRAL TYPES
C# type/keyword	Range	Size	.NET type
sbyte	-128 to 127	Signed 8-bit integer	System.SByte

byte	0 to 255	Unsigned 8-bit integer	System.Byte

short	-32,768 to 32,767	Signed 16-bit integer	System.Int16

ushort	0 to 65,535	Unsigned 16-bit integer	System.UInt16

int	-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647	Signed 32-bit integer	System.Int32

uint	0 to 4,294,967,295	Unsigned 32-bit integer	System.UInt32

long	-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807	Signed 64-bit integer	System.Int64

ulong	0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615	Unsigned 64-bit integer	System.UInt64

In the preceding table, each C# type keyword from the leftmost column is an alias for the corresponding .NET type. They are interchangeable. For example, the following declarations declare variables of the same type:
int a = 123;
System.Int32 b = 123;
The default value of each integral type is zero, 0. Each of the integral types has the MinValue and MaxValue constants that provide the minimum and maximum value of that type.
Use the System.Numerics.BigInteger structure to represent a signed integer with no upper or lower bounds.
Integer literals
Integer literals can be
•	decimal: without any prefix
•	hexadecimal: with the 0x or 0X prefix
•	binary: with the 0b or 0B prefix (available in C# 7.0 and later)
The following code demonstrates an example of each:
var decimalLiteral = 42;
var hexLiteral = 0x2A;
var binaryLiteral = 0b_0010_1010;
The preceding example also shows the use of _ as a digit separator, which is supported starting with C# 7.0. You can use the digit separator with all kinds of numeric literals.

The type of an integer literal is determined by its suffix as follows:
•	If the literal has no suffix, its type is the first of the following types in which its value can be represented: int, uint, long, ulong.
•	If the literal is suffixed by U or u, its type is the first of the following types in which its value can be represented: uint, ulong.
•	If the literal is suffixed by L or l, its type is the first of the following types in which its value can be represented: long, ulong.
 Note
You can use the lowercase letter l as a suffix. However, this generates a compiler warning because the letter l can be confused with the digit 1. Use L for clarity.
•	If the literal is suffixed by UL, Ul, uL, ul, LU, Lu, lU, or lu, its type is ulong.
If the value represented by an integer literal exceeds UInt64.MaxValue, a compiler error CS1021 occurs.
If the determined type of an integer literal is int and the value represented by the literal is within the range of the destination type, the value can be implicitly converted to sbyte, byte, short, ushort, uint, or ulong:
byte a = 17;
byte b = 300;   // CS0031: Constant value '300' cannot be converted to a 'byte'
As the preceding example shows, if the literal's value is not within the range of the destination type, a compiler error CS0031 occurs.
You can also use a cast to convert the value represented by an integer literal to the type other than the determined type of the literal:
var signedByte = (sbyte)42;
var longVariable = (long)42;










TryParse  	(GITHUB)
tryparse nedir

TryParse(String, Int32)	
Yukarıda TryParse metodunun parametrelerini görüyoruz. İlk parametresi string alıyormuş, diğeri ise int değer…
Yapısı ise şöyle:
public static bool TryParse (string s, out int result);

Yani ilk parametre olan string değerini alıyor, OUT ile bunu int'e çevirmeye çalışıyor.
Yani tryparse STRING'I INT'E ÇEVİRMEYE ÇALIŞIR.
Converts the string representation of a number to its 32-bit signed integer equivalent. A return value indicates whether the conversion succeeded.


Using TryParse
The most common and most recommended way of parsing an integer string is to use the TryParse static method on the Int32 type as follows:
string intString = "234";
int i = 0;
if (!Int32.TryParse(intString, out i))
{
   i = -1;
}
return i;
Using TryParse with Nullable Integer
When the above example fails to parse the string as a valid integer, you can see that we just set it to -1. This doesn't work too well if -1 one is a meaningful value in your program. Instead, we could parse the string and return a nullable int where the null value indicates that the input string was not a valid integer.
private int? ConvertStringToInt(string intString)
{
   int i=0;
   return (Int32.TryParse(intString, out i) ? i : (int?)null);
}
Using Convert
There is yet another way to parse a string to an integer which uses the Convert method, but this is a little less convenient than the previous example because we have to manage exceptions if something goes wrong. Exceptions are also expensive to throw so you don't generally want these to be an expected part of the flow of your program. This is especially true if the exceptions are throwing in a loop where there is the potential for a lot of them. This could really slow down your program. You'd be better in that case to use TryParse or maybe even Regex to validate the string is in the form you desire before trying the conversion.
int i = 0;
try
{
   i = System.Convert.ToInt32(intString);
}
catch (FormatException)
{
   // the FormatException is thrown when the string text does 
   // not represent a valid integer.
}
catch (OverflowException)
{
   // the OverflowException is thrown when the string is a valid integer, 
   // but is too large for a 32 bit integer.  Use Convert.ToInt64 in
   // this case.
}
There are benefits to using Convert over TryParse when you need to know why the parsing failed.
Also unlike the TryParse method, the Convert method has many overloads which allow you to convert almost any type to an integer. Here are just a few examples:
int i = 0;

// bool to Int32
bool b = true;
i = Convert.ToInt32(b);

// byte to Int32
byte bt = 3;
i = Convert.ToInt32(bt);

// char to Int32
char c = 'A';
i = Convert.ToInt32(c);

// DateTime to Int32
DateTime dt = DateTime.Now;
i = Convert.ToInt32(dt);

// Decimal to Int32
decimal d = 25.678m;
i = Convert.ToInt32(d);

// double to Int32
double db = 0.007234;
i = Convert.ToInt32(db);
That's just a few of the 19 or so different overloads for the Convert method. For all of them visit the MSDN documentation on Convert.ToInt32.

Type Casting	GITHUB)
Type casting nedir, casting nedir, convert nedir
Type casting is when you assign a value of one data type to another type.
Örnek:
       public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            double x = 1234.7;
            int a;

            // Cast double to int.
            a = (int)x;

            Console.WriteLine(a);

            
            double newDouble;
            int newInt = 42;

            //newDouble = (double)newInt; //redundant casting.. Gereksiz... Şöyle yazılır kısaca:
            newDouble = newInt;

            //bool u inte e cast etmeyi deneyelim:

            bool newBool1 = true;
            int asd;

            //asd = Convert.ToInt32(newBool1); // always true. yani çalıştı

            asd = Convert.ToInt32(newBool1); // always true. çalıştı

            //asd = (int)newBool1; // HATA

            int newInt2 = 20;

           //alttaki ikisi arasında ne fark var?
            string as3 = Convert.ToString(newInt2);

            string as4 = newInt2.ToString();
            
            //The basic difference between them is the Convert function handles NULLS while i.ToString () does not; it will throw a NULL reference exception error. So as good coding practice using convert is always safe.

            Console.ReadLine();
        }
In C#, there are two types of casting:
•	Implicit Casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size
char -> int -> long -> float -> double

•	Explicit Casting (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type
double -> float -> long -> int -> char
Implicit Casting
Implicit casting is done automatically when passing a smaller size type to a larger size type:
Example
int myInt = 9;
double myDouble = myInt;       // Automatic casting: int to double

Console.WriteLine(myInt);      // Outputs 9
Console.WriteLine(myDouble);   // Outputs 9
Run example »
________________________________________
Explicit Casting
Explicit casting must be done manually by placing the type in parentheses in front of the value:
Example
double myDouble = 9.78;
int myInt = (int) myDouble;    // Manual casting: double to int

Console.WriteLine(myDouble);   // Outputs 9.78
Console.WriteLine(myInt);      // Outputs 9

Asp.net core nedir

ASP.NET FRAMEWORK VS ASP.NET CORE 
ASP.Net Framework: 
4'e kadar çıktı versiyonu. 4.x te bitti. Sonra .NET Core başladı.
İlk başta Core'un adı Core değilmiş. ASP.NET 5'miş. Sonra Core'a dönmüş.

 

 
ASP.Net sadece Windowsta Run edilir. COre ise Wİndows, macOS ve Lİnux'ta run edilir.
ASP.NET Sadece IIS'te host edilir.
Core: IIS, Apache, Docker veya Self-host olarak host edilebilir.

ASP.net Core application initially starts as a Console application. (zaten dikkat edersen Main metodu var)
Main metot, bu console app'I configure eder, böylelikle console app ---> Web application'a dönüşür.

nullable bool and others
You typically use a nullable value type when you need to represent the undefined value of an underlying value type. For example, a Boolean, or bool, variable can only be either true or false. However, in some applications a variable value can be undefined or missing. For example, a database field may contain true or false, or it may contain no value at all, that is, NULL. You can use the bool? type in that scenario.
The default value of a nullable value type represents null, that is, it's an instance whose Nullable<T>.HasValue property returns false.
(as we know, represent means: be entitled or appointed to act or speak for (someone), especially in an official capacity.)
Nullable<int> n1 = new Nullable<int>(10);
private int n2 = new int();
int? n3 ;
int? n4 = null;

string s1 = new string("qqq");
--
Loop

            int val1 = 0;
            for (; val1 < 11; val1++)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(val1);

Object Oriented Programming / OOP / NYP
oop nedir, object oriented programming nedir, nyp nedir

Object oriented prensipleri nelerdir ? JAVA
Encapsulation  : Değişkenler private yapı larak get.. ve set.. metodlarıylaerişilir
Abstraction  : Gereksiz ayrıntı lar kullanıcıya sunulmaz
Inheritance    :  Bir  sını fın  özellikleri  extend  anahtar  kelimesiyle  miras alınır.
Polymorphism  :  Runtime  sırasında  oluşturulan  sını fın  metodununçağrı lmasıdır.[4],[5]

Nesne yönelimli programlama (NYP), (İngilizce: Object - Oriented Programming)(OOP), Her işlevin nesneler olarak soyutlandığı bir programlama yaklaşımıdır. NYP destekleyen programlama dilleri yüksek seviye diller olarak adlandırılır.

NYP'dan önceki uygulamaların bakım maliyeti ve karmaşıklık ilişkisi
NYP'dan önceki uygulamaların bakım maliyeti ve karmaşıklık ilişkisi
1960'lı yılların sonuna doğru ortaya çıkan bu yaklaşım, o dönemin yazılım dünyasında beliren bir bunalımın sonucudur. Yazılımların karmaşıklığı ve boyutları sürekli artıyor, ancak belli bir nitelik düzeyi korumak için gereken bakımın maliyeti zaman ve çaba olarak daha da hızlı artıyordu. NYP'yi bu soruna karşı bir çözüm haline getiren başlıca özelliği, yazılımda birimselliği (modularity) benimsemesidir. NYP ayrıca, bilgi gizleme (information hiding), veri soyutlama (data abstraction), çok biçimlilik (polymorphism) ve kalıtım (inheritance) gibi yazılımın bakımını ve aynı yazılım üzerinde birden fazla kişinin çalışmasını kolaylaştıran kavramları da yazılım literatürüne kazandırmıştır. Sağladığı bu avantajlardan dolayı, NYP günümüzde geniş çaplı yazılım projelerinde yaygın olarak kullanılmaktadır.

NYP'nin altında yatan birimselliğin ana fikri, her bilgisayar programının (izlence), etkileşim içerisinde olan birimler veya nesneler kümesinden oluştuğu varsayımıdır. Bu nesnelerin her biri, kendi içerisinde veri işleyebilir, ve diğer nesneler ile çift yönlü veri alışverişinde bulunabilir. Hâlbuki NYP'den önce var olan tek yaklaşımda (Yordamsal programlama), programlar sadece bir komut dizisi veya birer işlev (fonksiyon) kümesi olarak görülmektedirler.

Günümüzde çok çeşitli nesne tabanlı programlama dilleri olmasıyla beraber, en popüler diller sınıflar üzerine kurulmuşlardır (class-based). Bu dillerde nesneler sınıfların birer üyesidir ve nesnelerin tipini de bu sınıflar belirlerler.

En yaygın NYP dillerinden bazıları, Python, C++, Objective-C, Smalltalk, Delphi, Java, Swift, C#, Perl, Ruby ve PHP' dir.
Nesne yönelimli programlama dilleri yukarıda adı geçen tüm ögelere sahip olurken, Ada, JavaScript, Visual Basic gibi nesne tabanlı programlama dilleri birkaçından yoksundur, bu dillerin başlıca yoksunluğu kalıtıma sahip olmamalarıdır.

Nesneler ve sınıflar
NYP'yi destekleyen programlama dilleri genellikle tekrar kullanım ve genişletilebilirlik açısından, prototipler ve sınıflar şeklinde kod kalıtımına sahiptirler ve NYP deki nesneler kimi zaman gerçek dünyada bulunan şeylere karşılık gelebilir. Mesela bir grafik programı "kare", "üçgen" ve "yuvarlak" gibi nesnelere sahip olabilir. Bazen nesneler daha soyut şeyleri de temsil edebilirler, mesela bir hesap makinesi programı logaritma almanızı ya da metreyi fite çevirmenizi sağlayacak nesnelere sahip olabilir. İşte bu bahsi geçen nesneler belli sınıflar altında bulunurlar, mesela "Kasım" adında bir nesne Aylar sınıfının bir üyesi olabilir ya da "Faktöriyel" olarak isimlendirilmiş bir nesne Fonksiyonlar sınıfında yer alıyor olabilir.
Dependency inversion nedir
Clean architecture’ın arkasındaki ana prensip’lerden birisi ise, Dependency Inversion prensibidir. Bu prensip ile mimari içerisindeki modüllerimizi birbirinden ve farklı teknolojilerden daha decoupled bir hale getirebilmek mümkündür.

Git		(GITHUB)
git nedir

By far, the most widely used modern version control system in the world today is Git. Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel. A staggering number of software projects rely on Git for version control, including commercial projects as well as open source. Developers who have worked with Git are well represented in the pool of available software development talent and it works well on a wide range of operating systems and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).

Having a distributed architecture, Git is an example of a DVCS (hence Distributed Version Control System). Rather than have only one single place for the full version history of the software as is common in once-popular version control systems like CVS or Subversion (also known as SVN), in Git, every developer's working copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full history of all changes.

In addition to being distributed, Git has been designed with performance, security and flexibility in mind.

Performance
The raw performance characteristics of Git are very strong when compared to many alternatives. Committing new changes, branching, merging and comparing past versions are all optimized for performance. The algorithms implemented inside Git take advantage of deep knowledge about common attributes of real source code file trees, how they are usually modified over time and what the access patterns are.

Unlike some version control software, Git is not fooled by the names of the files when determining what the storage and version history of the file tree should be, instead, Git focuses on the file content itself. After all, source code files are frequently renamed, split, and rearranged. The object format of Git's repository files uses a combination of delta encoding (storing content differences), compression and explicitly stores directory contents and version metadata objects.

Being distributed enables significant performance benefits as well.

For example, say a developer, Alice, makes changes to source code, adding a feature for the upcoming 2.0 release, then commits those changes with descriptive messages. She then works on a second feature and commits those changes too. Naturally these are stored as separate pieces of work in the version history. Alice then switches to the version 1.3 branch of the same software to fix a bug that affects only that older version. The purpose of this is to enable Alice's team to ship a bug fix release, version 1.3.1, before version 2.0 is ready. Alice can then return to the 2.0 branch to continue working on new features for 2.0 and all of this can occur without any network access and is therefore fast and reliable. She could even do it on an airplane. When she is ready to send all of the individually committed changes to the remote repository, Alice can "push" them in one command.

Security
Git has been designed with the integrity of managed source code as a top priority. The content of the files as well as the true relationships between files and directories, versions, tags and commits, all of these objects in the Git repository are secured with a cryptographically secure hashing algorithm called SHA1. This protects the code and the change history against both accidental and malicious change and ensures that the history is fully traceable.

With Git, you can be sure you have an authentic content history of your source code.

Some other version control systems have no protections against secret alteration at a later date. This can be a serious information security vulnerability for any organization that relies on software development.

Flexibility
One of Git's key design objectives is flexibility. Git is flexible in several respects: in support for various kinds of nonlinear development workflows, in its efficiency in both small and large projects and in its compatibility with many existing systems and protocols.

Git has been designed to support branching and tagging as first-class citizens (unlike SVN) and operations that affect branches and tags (such as merging or reverting) are also stored as part of the change history. Not all version control systems feature this level of tracking.

Version control with Git
Git is the best choice for most software teams today. While every team is different and should do their own analysis, here are the main reasons why version control with Git is preferred over alternatives:

Git is good
Git has the functionality, performance, security and flexibility that most teams and individual developers need. These attributes of Git are detailed above. In side-by-side comparisons with most other alternatives, many teams find that Git is very favorable.

Git is a de facto standard
Git is the most broadly adopted tool of its kind. This is makes Git attractive for the following reasons. At Atlassian, nearly all of our project source code is managed in Git.

Vast numbers of developers already have Git experience and a significant proportion of college graduates may have experience with only Git. While some organizations may need to climb the learning curve when migrating to Git from another version control system, many of their existing and future developers do not need to be trained on Git.

In addition to the benefits of a large talent pool, the predominance of Git also means that many third party software tools and services are already integrated with Git including IDEs, and our own tools like DVCS desktop client Sourcetree, issue and project tracking software, Jira, and code hosting service, Bitbucket.

If you are an inexperienced developer wanting to build up valuable skills in software development tools, when it comes to version control, Git should be on your list.

Git is a quality open source project
Git is a very well supported open source project with over a decade of solid stewardship. The project maintainers have shown balanced judgment and a mature approach to meeting the long term needs of its users with regular releases that improve usability and functionality. The quality of the open source software is easily scrutinized and countless businesses rely heavily on that quality.

Git enjoys great community support and a vast user base. Documentation is excellent and plentiful, including books, tutorials and dedicated web sites. There are also podcasts and video tutorials.

Being open source lowers the cost for hobbyist developers as they can use Git without paying a fee. For use in open-source projects, Git is undoubtedly the successor to the previous generations of successful open source version control systems, SVN and CVS.

Criticism of Git
One common criticism of Git is that it can be difficult to learn. Some of the terminology in Git will be novel to newcomers and for users of other systems, the Git terminology may be different, for example, revert in Git has a different meaning than in SVN or CVS. Nevertheless, Git is very capable and provides a lot of power to its users. Learning to use that power can take some time, however once it has been learned, that power can be used by the team to increase their development speed.

For those teams coming from a non-distributed VCS, having a central repository may seem like a good thing that they don't want to lose. However, while Git has been designed as a distributed version control system (DVCS), with Git, you can still have an official, canonical repository where all changes to the software must be stored. With Git, because each developer's repository is complete, their work doesn't need to be constrained by the availability and performance of the "central" server. During outages or while offline, developers can still consult the full project history. Because Git is flexible as well as being distributed, you can work the way you are accustomed to but gain the additional benefits of Git, some of which you may not even realise you're missing.

Now that you understand what version control is, what Git is and why software teams should use it, read on to discover the benefits Git can provide across the whole organization.

Compiler / Derleyici  (GITHUB) (örnek)
compiler nedir, derleyici nedir
Programcılıkta, bir programlama dilinde yazılmış olan kaynak kodunu başka bir dile (genellikle makine koduna) çeviren yazılım. Derleyiciye bunu yaptırmaktaki amaç genellikle çalışabilir bir yazılım elde etmektir. Kullanıcıların programları kullanırken kolaylık sağlamak amaçlı geliştirilmiştir... Örneğin, şu satırı bir programın kaynak kodunda (programın okunabilir hali) düşünelim:
 
Alttaki assembly'de yazılmış satırlar, aynı programın derlenmiş halidir:

LOAD A [0]        ;; belleğin 0 adresindeki veriyi A siciline yükle 

ADD  A BX         ;; A siciline BX sicilindeki adreste bulunan veriyi ekle 

STOR A [100]      ;; sonucu 100 adresine yaz

Bu örnekte çevirinin hedefi, programcının anladığı kaynak kodundan işlemcinin anladığı 0 ile 1 den oluşan makine dili kodunu üretmek (LOAD,ADD ve STOR komutları 0001, 0011 ve 0010 olarak yorumlanır)

In computing, a compiler is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another language (the target language). The name "compiler" is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language (e.g., assembly language, object code, or machine code) to create an executable program.[1][2]:p1

However, there are many different types of compilers. If the compiled program can run on a computer whose CPU or operating system is different from the one on which the compiler runs, the compiler is a cross-compiler. A bootstrap compiler is written in the language that it intends to compile. A program that translates from a low-level language to a higher level one is a decompiler. A program that translates between high-level languages is usually called a source-to-source compiler or transcompiler. A language rewriter is usually a program that translates the form of expressions without a change of language. The term compiler-compiler refers to tools used to create parsers that perform syntax analysis.

A compiler is likely to perform many or all of the following operations: preprocessing, lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis (syntax-directed translation), conversion of input programs to an intermediate representation, code optimization and code generation. Compilers implement these operations in phases that promote efficient design and correct transformations of source input to target output. Program faults caused by incorrect compiler behavior can be very difficult to track down and work around; therefore, compiler implementers invest significant effort to ensure compiler correctness.[3]

Compilers are not the only language processor used to transform source programs. An interpreter is computer software that transforms and then executes the indicated operations.[2]:p2 The translation process influences the design of computer languages, which leads to a preference of compilation or interpretation. In practice, an interpreter can be implemented for compiled languages and compilers can be implemented for interpreted languages.

History

A diagram of the operation of a typical multi-language, multi-target compiler
A diagram of the operation of a typical multi-language, multi-target compiler
Theoretical computing concepts developed by scientists, mathematicians, and engineers formed the basis of digital modern computing development during World War II. Primitive binary languages evolved because digital devices only understand ones and zeros and the circuit patterns in the underlying machine architecture. In the late 1940s, assembly languages were created to offer a more workable abstraction of the computer architectures. Limited memory capacity of early computers led to substantial technical challenges when the first compilers were designed. Therefore, the compilation process needed to be divided into several small programs. The front end programs produce the analysis products used by the back end programs to generate target code. As computer technology provided more resources, compiler designs could align better with the compilation process.

It is usually more productive for a programmer to use a high-level language, so the development of high-level languages followed naturally from the capabilities offered by digital computers. High-level languages are formal languages that are strictly defined by their syntax and semantics which form the high-level language architecture. Elements of these formal languages include:

Alphabet, any finite set of symbols;
String, a finite sequence of symbols;
Language, any set of strings on an alphabet.
The sentences in a language may be defined by a set of rules called a grammar.

Polymorphism
Polymorphism nedir?
Polymorphism is often referred to as the third pillar of object-oriented programming, after encapsulation and inheritance. Polymorphism is a Greek word that means "many-shaped" and it has two distinct aspects.
•	At run time, objects of a derived class may be treated as objects of a base class in places such as method parameters and collections or arrays. When this occurs, the object's declared type is no longer identical to its run-time type.
•	Base classes may define and implement virtual methods, and derived classes can override them, which means they provide their own definition and implementation. At run-time, when client code calls the method, the CLR looks up the run-time type of the object, and invokes that override of the virtual method. Thus in your source code you can call a method on a base class, and cause a derived class's version of the method to be executed.

The word polymorphism means having many forms. In object-oriented programming paradigm, polymorphism is often expressed as 'one interface, multiple functions'.
Polymorphism can be static or dynamic. In static polymorphism, the response to a function is determined at the compile time. In dynamic polymorphism, it is decided at run-time.


Instance Method = Non Static Method
Instance method nedir, instance method nedir, non static method nedir, non-static method nedir
Instance method bildiğin class'ın instance'ının sahip olduğu, bildiğimiz metodlardır. Static olmayan, bildiğimiz klasik metotlar.
Static Method	Non Static Method (Instance Method)
1. Static method is defined with the static keyword.	1. Non Static Method is defined without static keyword.
2. Static method is called by its class name	2. Non Static Method is called by making the object of a class.
3. We can’t use this keyword inside the Static Method	3. We can use thiskeyword inside Non Static Method
4. Static Method uses the memory of Class	4. Non Static Method uses a memory of an object


Instance method are methods which require an object of its class to be created before it can be called. To invoke a instance method, we have to create an Object of the class in within which it defined.
public void geek(String name)
{
 // code to be executed....
}
// Return type can be int, float String or user defined data type.
Memory allocation: These methods themselves are stored in Permanent Generation space of heap but the parameters (arguments passed to them) and their local variables and the value to be returned are allocated in stack. They can be called within the same class in which they reside or from the different classes defined either in the same package or other packages depend on the access type provided to the desired instance method.

Important Points:
•	Instance method(s) belong to the Object of the class not to the class i.e. they can be called after creating the Object of the class.
•	Every individual Object created from the class has its own copy of the instance method(s) of that class.
•	Instance methods are not stored on a per-instance basis, even with virtual methods. They’re stored in a single memory location, and they only “know” which object they belong to because the this pointer is passed when you call them.
•	They can be overridden since they are resolved using dynamic binding at run time. (dynamic binding'in runtime'da yapıldığını öğrenmiştik. metoda verilen argument'lerin zaten runtime'da değiştirilebildiğini biliyoruz.Yani buradan zaten bu sonuca kendimiz de varabiliriz: Bu bir Dynamic Binding olayıdır.


When to use static methods ??
•	When you have code that can be shared across all instances of the same class, put that portion of code into static method.
•	They are basically used to access static field(s) of the class.
 Instance method vs Static method
•	Instance method can access the instance methods and instance variables directly.
•	Instance method can access static variables and static methods directly.
•	Static methods can access the static variables and static methods directly.
•	Static methods can’t access instance methods and instance variables directly. They must use reference to object. And static method can’t use this keyword as there is no instance for ‘this’ to refer to.

Static Method nedir? (GITHUB)
Static method nedir

A static method in C# is a method that keeps only one copy of the method at the Type level, not the object level. That means, all instances of the class share the same copy of the method and its data. The last updated value of the method is shared among all objects of that Type. 

Static methods are called by using the class name, not the instance of the class. 
 
The Console class and its Read and Write methods are an example of static methods. The following code example calls Console.WriteLine and Console.ReadKey methods without creating an instance of the Console class. 
C# supports two types of class methods, static methods, and non static methods. Any normal method is a non static method. 
1.	class Program  
2.	{  
3.	    public static void withoutObj()  
4.	    {  
5.	        Console.WriteLine("Hello");  
6.	    }  
7.	     static void Main()  
8.	    {  
9.	        Program. withoutObj();  
10.	        Console.ReadKey();  
11.	    }  
12.	}  

Using Static Method
Usually we define a set of data members for a class and then every object of that class will have a separate copy of each of those data members. Let's have an example.
1.	class Program  
2.	  {  
3.	      public int myVar;  //a non-static field  
4.	        static void Main()  
5.	      {  
6.	          Program p1 = new Program();  //a object of class  
7.	          p1.myVar = 10;  
8.	          Console.WriteLine(p1.myVar);  
9.	          Console.ReadKey();  
10.	      }  
11.	  }  

In the above example, myVar is a non-static field so to use this field we first need to create the object of that class. On the other hand, static data is shared among all the objects of that class. That is, for all the objects of a class, there will be only one copy of static data. Let's have an example.
1.	class Program  
2.	 {  
3.	     public static int myVar;  //a static field  
4.	       static void Main()  
5.	     {  
6.	         //Program p1 = new Program();  //a object of class  
7.	         myVar = 10;  
8.	         Console.WriteLine(myVar);  
9.	         Console.ReadKey();  
10.	     }  
11.	 }  
In the above we don't have an object of the class to use that field since the field is static.
If you create your own class and you think only one copy of the data (method) is needed among all instances of the class, you can create your own static method.  Learn more here: Static Class  and Static Class Members In C#
Notable Points here are:
1.	A static method can be invoked directly from the class level
2.	A static method does not require any class object
3.	Any main() method is shared through the entire class scope so it always appears with static keyword.
C# language also has several other types of methods. Read more Types of Methods in C#.

Static Class (GITHUB)
Static class nedir
A static class is a class which can not be instantiated. We do not need to create an object of a static class like we did in non-static classes. Members of static classes can be accessed directly using the class name followed by a (.) and class member name. Class Members can be methods, fields, properties, or events. A static class can contain only the static members while a non-static class can contain static members. Also, Static classes are by-default sealed so they cannot be inherited.

To declare a class and its members as static, 'static' keyword are used as shown below,
1.	using System;  
2.	  
3.	namespace Tutpoint  
4.	{  
5.	    // Static class  
6.	    static class TutLovers  
7.	    {  
8.	        // Static Variable  
9.	        public static int val_Static;  
10.	  
11.	        // Static Method  
12.	        public static void Addition_Static()  
13.	        {  
14.	            Console.Write("Static Method");  
15.	        }  
16.	  
17.	        // Static property  
18.	        public static int Addition_NonStatic  
19.	        {  
20.	            get; set;  
21.	        }  
22.	    }  
For more understanding see the example shown below,

The example shown below contains two non-static classes named "TutLovers" and "TutHaters". Here a class "TutLovers" contains static as well as non-static methods and variable. When we access them from class "TutHaters" then, For the static members, they will be accessed directly using class name followed by (.) and
For non-static members, we have created an object of that class.


1.	using System;  
2.	  
3.	namespace Tutpoint  
4.	{  
5.	    class TutLovers  
6.	    {  
7.	        public static int val_Static;  
8.	  
9.	        public int val_NonStatic;  
10.	  
11.	        public static void Addition_Static()  
12.	        {  
13.	            Console.Write("Static Method");  
14.	        }  
15.	  
16.	        public void Addition_NonStatic()  
17.	        {  
18.	            Console.Write("Non-Static Method");  
19.	        }  
20.	    }  
21.	  
22.	    //If the class is non-static  
23.	    class TutHaters  
24.	    {  
25.	        public void Haters()  
26.	        {  
27.	            //Object of TutLovers class is created  
28.	            TutLovers tutLovers = new TutLovers();  
29.	  
30.	            //Non-Static members can be called only from object  
31.	            tutLovers.Addition_NonStatic();  
32.	            tutLovers.val_NonStatic = 5;  
33.	  
34.	            //Static members can only be called using class_name followed by a (.)  
35.	            TutLovers.Addition_Static();  
36.	            TutLovers.val_Static = 5;  
37.	  
38.	            /* When we try to access static member from object then it will create an error  
39.	            Error as "Members 'TutLovers.Addition_Static()' can not be accessed with an instance referen            -ce; qualify it with a type name instead" */
40.	            tutLovers.Addition_Static();  
41.	  
42.	            /* When we try to access non-static member using class_name then it will create an error  
43.	            Error as "An object reference is required for the non-static field                                      , method or property 'TutLovers.Addition_NonStatic()'" */
44.	            TutLovers.Addition_NonStatic();  
45.	        }  
46.	    }  
47.	  
48.	}  
As shown above, when we try to access static member with an instance reference, it will create an error as "Members 'TutLovers.Addition_Static()' can not be accessed with an instance reference; qualify it with a type name instead" and when we try to access non-static member using class_name then it will create an error as "An object reference is required for the non-static field, method or property 'TutLovers.Addition_NonStatic()'".

Virtual Method 	(GITHUB) (notread)
Virtual Method nedir

Virtual (sanal metod) ‘lar kalıtıldığı sınıflarda içeriği değiştirilebilen metodlardır. Yani temel sınfımız da bir method oluşturuyoruz. Bu methodun içeriğini ileride değiştirme ihtiyacı duyuyoruz bu gibi durumlarda methodumuza virtual anahtar kelimesini ekleyerek override (ezmek) etmeye olanak tanımış oluyoruz. Bir örnek ile anlatırsak daha iyi olabilir.
Virtual metodları aslında bir çok yerde kullanabiliriz, ama genel olarak kullanım şekilleri aşağıdaki gibidir.
•	Sadece metod isimlerini belirteceğimiz bir classımız olsun, metodların ne işlev yapacağını diğer classlarda belirtecek isek Virtual metod kullanırız.
•	Birden çok Class larımızın, aynı anlama gelen metodları varsa, bu metodu Virtual olarak tanımlarız.
•	Yazılımda standartlaşmak önemlidir, eğer geliştirilen uygulamamızın farklı modüllerinde, metod isimlerimizin aynı olması isteniyorsa, yine Virtual metod kullanırız.

Örneğimizi İnceleyelim;
public class Cizim
{
   public int sayi { get; set; }
    public virtual void Draw()
    {
        //Draw methodunu virtual olarak yazıyorum ki daha sonra içeriği değiştirilebilsin.
        Console.WriteLine("Ben cizim nesnesiyim");
     }
}
public class cizgi : Cizim
{
    public override void Draw()
    {
        //Override etmeden önceki kodu çalıştırç
        base.Draw();
        Console.WriteLine("Ben cizim nesnesiyim-----------------");
     }
}
Çıktısı;
 
Örneğimizde Çizim nesnesindeki Draw methodunu override ederek içeriğini değiştiriyoruz.
DETAY:
A virtual method is a method that can be redefined in derived classes. A virtual method has an implementation in a base class as well as derived the class. It is used when a method's basic functionality is the same but sometimes more functionality is needed in the derived class. A virtual method is created in the base class that can be overriden in the derived class. We create a virtual method in the base class using the virtual keyword and that method is overriden in the derived class using the override keyword.
 
When a method is declared as a virtual method in a base class then that method can be defined in a base class and it is optional for the derived class to override that method. The overriding method also provides more than one form for a method. Hence it is also an example for polymorphism.
 
When a method is declared as a virtual method in a base class and that method has the same definition in a derived class then there is no need to override it in the derived class. But when a virtual method has a different definition in the base class and the derived class then there is a need to override it in the derived class.
 
When a virtual method is invoked, the run-time type of the object is checked for an overriding member. The overriding member in the most derived class is called, which might be the original member, if no derived class has overridden the member.
Virtual Method in C#
1.	By default, methods are non-virtual. We can't override a non-virtual method.
2.	We can't use the virtual modifier with the static, abstract, private or override modifiers. 
Difference between virtual and non-virtual methods
 
We have two classes; one is a "Vehicle" class and another is a "Cart" class. The "Vehicle" class is the base class that has two methods; one is a virtual method "Speed()" and another is a non-virtual method "Average()". So the base class virtual method "Speed()" is overriden in the sub class. We have one more class "Program" (the execution class) that has an entry point where we create an instance of sub class "Cart" and that instance is assigned to the base class "Vehicle" type. When we call virtual and non-virtual methods by both class's instance then according to the run type the instance virtual method implementation is invoked; in other words both class's instances invoke the subclass override method and the non-virtual method invoked is determined based on the instance of the class.

Invoked Virtual Method that override and not override in derived classes
 
We have three classes "Shape","Rectangle" and "Circle". Class "Shape" is a base class. Both "Rectangle" and "Circle" are derived classes from the base class. Base class "Shape" has virtual method "Area()". Virtual method "Area()" is overriden in the derived class "Rectangle" but not overriden in the derived class "Circle". When the virtual methods are overriden in a derived class and that derived class uses an instance then invokes a derived class overriden method. When a virtual method is not overriden in a derived class and uses that derived class instance then invokes base class virtual method.

Command Line Interface / CLI (GITHUB)
Command Line Interface nedir, cli nedir, CLI nedir

Örneğin windows'taki CLI, şu siyah ekrana sahip olan, içinde sadece kodlar bulunan, içine sadece kodlar yazılan o ekrandır. 

CLI stands for:

Command Line Interface
Command Line Interpreter
Command Line Input
Command Line Input
CLI is a command line program that accepts text input to execute operating system functions.

In the 1960s, using only computer terminals, this was the only way to interact with computers.

In the 1970s an 1980s, command line input was commonly used by Unix systems and PC systems like MS-DOS and Apple DOS.

Today, with graphical user interfaces (GUI), most users never use command-line interfaces (CLI).

However, CLI is still used by software developers and system administrators to configure computers, install software, and access features that are not available in the graphical interface.

Examples
The software package manager npm uses command line input to install software:

Windows Example
C:\>npm install mysoftware
Mac OS Example
>npm install mysoftware
You can navigate your folders (directories) with command line commands:

Windows Example
C:\Users\myuser>cd ..
C:\Users\>cd ..
C:\>
Use CLI commands with great attention!!!

Wrong use can easily delete files or destroy your computer system completely.

Basic Linux CLI Commands
Command	Description
ls	List the directory (folder) system.
cd pathname	Change directory (folder) in the file system.
cd ..	Move one level up (one folder) in the file system.
cp	Copy a file to another folder.
mv	Move a file to another folder.
mkdir	Creates a new directory (folder).
rmdir	Remove a directory (folder).
clear	Clears the CLI window.
exit	Closes the CLI window.
man command	Shows the manual for a given command.
Basic Windows CLI Commands

Integration (GITHUB)  (read)
integration nedir
Integration is the act of bringing together smaller components into a single system that functions as one. In an IT context, integration refers to the end result of a process that aims to stitch together different, often disparate, subsystems so that the data contained in each becomes part of a larger, more comprehensive system that, ideally, quickly and easily shares data when needed. This often requires that companies build a customized architecture or structure of applications to combine new or existing hardware, software and other communications.

Integration is harder to achieve the greater the number of systems that are involved and companies often choose to have external contractors manage some or all phases of the development of the new system. Specific activities having to do with IT system integration include project planning, project management, design and implementation of application programming interfaces, Web services and any process that accounts for the free flow of data or information delivery.
Challenges to achieving integration mostly have to do with the inherent difficulties in linking a series of diverse existing systems that could be produced by multiple different manufacturers. Other integration challenges have to do with the lack of a coherent or unifying data structure linking all of the different systems, an unwieldy framework of multiple different applications and support systems, the sheer age of the different systems and the actual delivery of the information to key business units that need it. These integration challenges hinder overall process efficiency because poor data exchange between systems prevents quick communication among business units.

On-premises Software  	(GITHUB)
on premises software nedir, on-premises software nedir, on premise software nedir, on premise nedir
-Şirket içi yazılımlar, sunucu çiftliği veya bulut gibi uzak bir tesise değil, yazılımı kullanan kişi veya kuruluşun tesislerine yüklenir ve bilgisayarlarda çalışır.
Bildiğin "yerel" yani.
On-premises software (commonly misstated as on-premise, and alternatively abbreviated "on-prem")[1] is installed and runs on computers on the premises of the person or organization using the software, rather than at a remote facility such as a server farm or cloud. On-premises software is sometimes referred to as “shrinkwrap” software, and off-premises software is commonly called “software as a service” ("SaaS") or “cloud computing”.
Grammar
There is some debate as to the grammatical correctness of the term on-premise as a synonym for on-premises.[2][3][4] In normal English usage, a premise is a proposition or presupposition in a logical argument, while premises (as well as being the plural of premise) means a property and its grounds, and is used only in the plural form.[5] People have mistakenly used what they believe to be the singular form premise, yet such use is incorrect in common or legal contexts.[6] When referring to technology, many companies and news sources commonly misuse the term on-premise such that it has become a common variant of on-premises.[7] [8]

CLR	(GITHUB) (not yet)
CLR nedir
Common Language Runtime.
The exact meaning depends on the context, but Common Language Runtime usually refers to the runtime of .NET Framework. The CLR handles memory allocation and management. The CLR is also a virtual machine that not only executes apps but also generates and compiles code on-the-fly using a JIT compiler. The current Microsoft CLR implementation is Windows only.
.Net Framework ün en alt katmanında CLR (Common Languange Runtime – Ortak Dil Platformu) mevcuttur. 
.Net platformunda yazılmış olan kodların (c#, J# veya VB) ortak bir alanda işletim sisteminizin algılayacağı dile çevrilmesini sağlamaktadır. Bu işlem sırasında kodlar ilk olarak MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Languange – Ara Dil) e çevrilir. Bu dönüştürmenin sebebi işletim sisteminin algılayacağı dile dönüştürmeden önce farklı dillerde yazılan kodları ortak noktada buluşturmaktır. Böylelikle MSIL kodu CLR katmanı ile farklı işletim sistemlerinde çalıştırılabilir hale gelir ve gelecekte yeni bir dille yazılan kodlar da MSIL a dönüştürerek işletim sisteminde çalışmasını sağlayacaktır.

ByteCode	(GITHUB) (not yet)
ByteCode nedir
Bytecode is program code that has been compiled from source code into low-level code designed for a software interpreter. It may be executed by a virtual machine (such as a JVM) or further compiled into machine code, which is recognized by the processor.
Different types of bytecode use different syntax, which can be read and executed by the corresponding virtual machine. A popular example is Java bytecode, which is compiled from Java source code and can be run on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Below are examples of Java bytecode instructions.
new (create new object)
aload_0 (load reference)
istore (store integer value)
ladd (add long value)
swap (swap two values)
areturn (return value from a function)
While it is possible to write bytecode directly, it is much more difficult than writing code in a high-level language, like Java. Therefore, bytecode files, such as Java .CLASS files, are most often generated from source code using a compiler, like javac.

Bytecode vs Assembly Language
Bytecode is similar to assembly language in that it is not a high-level language, but it is still somewhat readable, unlike machine language. Both may be considered "intermediate languages" that fall between source code and machine code. The primary difference between the two is that bytecode is generated for a virtual machine (software), while assembly language is created for a CPU (hardware).
The key of java power "Write once, run everywhere" is bytecode. The way bytecodes get converted to the appropriate native instructions for an application has a huge impact on the speed of an application. These bytecode can be interpreted, compiled to native code or directly executed on a processor whose Instruction Set Architecture is the bytecode specification. Interpreting the bytecode which is the standard implementation of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) makes execution of programs slow. To improve performance, JIT compilers interact with the JVM at run time and compile appropriate bytecode sequences into native machine code. When using a JIT compiler, the hardware can execute the native code, as opposed to having the JVM interpret the same sequence of bytecode repeatedly and incurring the penalty of a relatively lengthy translation process. This can lead to performance gains in the execution speed, unless methods are executed less frequently. The time that a JIT compiler takes to compile the bytecode is added to the overall execution time, and could lead to a higher execution time than an interpreter for executing the bytecode if the methods that are compiled by the JIT are not invoked frequently. The JIT compiler performs certain optimizations when compiling the bytecode to native code. Since the JIT compiler translates a series of bytecode into native instructions, it can perform some simple optimizations. Some of the common optimizations performed by JIT compilers are data-analysis, translation from stack operations to register operations, reduction of memory accesses by register allocation, elimination of common sub-expressions etc. The higher the degree of optimization done by a JIT compiler, the more time it spends in the execution stage. Therefore a JIT compiler cannot afford to do all the optimizations that is done by a static compiler, both because of the overhead added to the execution time and because it has only a restricted view of the program.

Memory Allocation	(GITHUB) (not yet)
Memory Allocation nedir
What does Memory Allocation mean?
Memory allocation is a process by which computer programs and services are assigned with physical or virtual memory space.

Memory allocation is the process of reserving a partial or complete portion of computer memory for the execution of programs and processes. Memory allocation is achieved through a process known as memory management.
Memory allocation is primarily a computer hardware operation but is managed through operating system and software applications. Memory allocation process is quite similar in physical and virtual memory management. Programs and services are assigned with a specific memory as per their requirements when they are executed. Once the program has finished its operation or is idle, the memory is released and allocated to another program or merged within the primary memory.
Memory allocation has two core types;
Static Memory Allocation: The program is allocated memory at compile time.
Dynamic Memory Allocation: The programs are allocated with memory at run time.

Executable Code (GITHUB)
Executable Code nedir
Software in a form that can be run in the computer. Executable code generally refers to machine language, which is the set of native instructions the computer carries out in hardware. Executable files in the DOS/Windows world use .EXE and .COM file extensions, while executable files in Mac, Linux and Unix do not require specific extensions. They are identified by their file structure.

Executable code may also refer to programs written in interpreted languages that require additional software to actually execute. Some interpreted languages remain in their source code form, such as JavaScript and VBScript, while others are compiled into an intermediate language, such as Java and Visual Basic. Interpreted languages require software "runtime engines" to convert the program into executable instructions for a particular CPU family that the hardware executes. See machine language, runtime engine, linker, compiler, intermediate language, x86 and Java Virtual Machine.

J# (GITHUB)
J# nedir 
Visual J# (pronounced "jay-sharp") is an implementation of the J# programming language that was a transitional language for programmers of Java and Visual J++ languages, so they could use their existing knowledge and applications with the .NET Framework.[1][2] It was introduced in 2002 and discontinued in 2007, with support for the final release of the product continuing until October 2017.
Fundamental differences between J# and Java
Java and J# use the same general syntax but there are non-Java conventions in J# to support the .NET environment. For example, to use .NET "properties" with a standard JavaBean class, it is necessary to prefix getter and setter methods with the Javadoc-like annotation:            /** @beanproperty   */ 
J# does not compile Java-language source code to Java bytecode.
JavaWorld said: "J#'s interface to the .NET framework is solid, but not as seamless as C#. In particular, J# code cannot define new .NET attributes, events, value types, or delegates. J# can make use of these language constructs if they are defined in an assembly written in another language, but its inability to define new ones limits J#'s reach and interoperability compared to other .NET languages."[5]

Statik Tipli Diller İle Dinamik Tipli Diller Arasındaki Farklar 	(edited,ekle) (Read)
Statik tipli dil nedir, statik tipli diller nedir, statik dil nedir
Programlama dillerinde yapılan her işlem öncesi hataları önlemek için verilerin tip kontrolü yapılır. Bu tür kontrollere ”Checking”  adı verilir. Checking işlemleri compile-time (derleme esnasında) veya run-time (çalışma esnasında) olarak yapılır. 

İşte bu farklılık Statik Tipli ve Dinamik Tipli dillerin temel ayrım noktalarından biridir.

Statik Tipli dillerde her değişkenin değişmez bir tipi olmak zorundadır. Uygulama geliştirenler ya bu tipi bizzat belirler yada Derleyici tarafından belirlenir. 

Statik Tipli dillerde yapılan işlemlerden önce Tip Konrolü yapıldığı için, operandların tiplerinin belirlenmesi gerekir. Tip kontrolleri compile (derleme) esnasında yapılır. 
Bu tarz dillere örnek olarak Java, C, C++ ,C# ,F# ,Aida ,Fortran ,Haskell ,ML ,Objective-C ,Pascal dilleri verilebilir.

Değişkenlerin ve ifadelerin tipleri run-time (çalışma) esnasında belirlenir. 

Bu tarz dillere örnek olarak Groovy, Javascript, Lisp, Lua, PHP, Prolog, Python, Ruby, Smalltalk dilleri verilebilir.

Statik Tipli Diller ile Dinamik Tipli dillerin birbirlerine üstünlükleri konusunda birçok fikir ortaya atılıyor. İkisinin de birbirlerine üstün oldukları noktalar var.

Statik Tipli dillerde derleme (compile-time) esnasında tip kontrolü yapıldığı için programın çalışması esnasında ekstra tip kontrolü yapılmaz, bu da uygulamanın çok daha verimli ve hızlı çalışması anlamına gelir. 

Dinamik Tipli dillerde ise çalışma (run-time) esnasında kontrol yapılması ufak da olsa bir yavaşlamaya sebep olmaktadır. Ayrıca yine bu özellikten dolayı her değişkenin tip bilgisi hafızada saklanmak zorundadır. Bu durum ekstra bir hafıza yükü anlamına gelir. Statik Tipli dillerde derleme (compile-time) esnasında tip kontrolü yapıldığı için ekstra bir hafızaya gerek duyulmaz.

Statik Tipli dillerde derleme (compile-time) esnasında herhangi bir hata yakalanmadı ise tip hatası oluşmamış demektir yani Dinamik Tipli dillere nazaran çok daha güvenlidir. Dinamik Tipli dillerde ise böyle bir kesinlik bulunmaz. 

Öte yandan Dinamik Tipli diller Developer’lara çok büyük esneklik sağlar. Gelen verinin türünün bilinmediği uygulamalarda çok kullanışlıdır. Ayrıca uygulama geliştirenler bir değişkene farklı noktalarda farklı değerler atayabilirler.

Dynamic typing vs. static typing
This topic is provided for reverence only as it explains the differences between dynamic and static typing. Understanding the differences between dynamic and static typing is key to understanding the way in which transformation script errors are handled, and how it is different from the way Groovy handles errors. This will also help you interpret errors created by your transformation script.
Note: It is important to know that the Groovy implementation within Big Data Discovery enforces static typing. For information on exception handling in Transform, which uses a static parser overriding Groovy's dynamic typing behavior, see Exception handling and troubleshooting your scripts.
There are two main differences between dynamic typing and static typing that you should be aware of when writing transformation scripts.
First, dynamically-typed languages perform type checking at runtime, while statically typed languages perform type checking at compile time. This means that scripts written in dynamically-typed languages (like Groovy) can compile even if they contain errors that will prevent the script from running properly (if at all). If a script written in a statically-typed language (such as Java) contains errors, it will fail to compile until the errors have been fixed.
Second, statically-typed languages require you to declare the data types of your variables before you use them, while dynamically-typed languages do not. Consider the two following code examples:
// Java example
int num;
num = 5;
// Groovy example
num = 5
Both examples do the same thing: create a variable called num and assign it the value 5. The difference lies in the first line of the Java example, int num;, which defines num's data type as int. Java is statically-typed, so it expects its variables to be declared before they can be assigned values. 
Groovy is dynamically-typed and determines its variables' data types based on their values, so this line is not required.
Dynamically-typed languages are more flexible and can save you time and space when writing scripts. However, this can lead to issues at runtime. For example:
// Groovy example
number = 5
numbr = (number + 15) / 2  // note the typo
The code above should create the variable number with a value of 5, then change its value to 10 by adding 15 to it and dividing it by 2. However, number is misspelled at the beginning of the second line. Because Groovy does not require you to declare your variables, it creates a new variable called numbr and assigns it the value number should have. This code will compile just fine, but may produce an error later on when the script tries to do something with number assuming its value is 10.
Güzel anlatım:
What is static typing? And what’s dynamic typing? I’ll answer both questions in this introductory article, and we’ll discuss the debate surrounding the very definition of these concepts.
You do not have to know any particular programming language to understand the concepts; however, I shall make references to the programming language Perl, PHP and Python, (in the form of codes) in the article. Those who don’t know Python should think of the code as pseudocode, and things will just be fine. Static typing and dynamic typing are the concerns of programming language design; thus a lack of knowledge of any particular type is not going to harm your understanding of these concepts. In all the code fragments within this article, I have explicitly mentioned the programming language in which the code is written, using "/*……*/" (quotes not included).
To begin with, I should mention that "typing" in terms of static and dynamic typing refers to "type" as in data type — not the process of pressing keys on a keyboard. Though this might have sounded quite obvious, it may not be to some. "Static" and "dynamic" are the types of "typing" that we shall see in the sections that follow. Languages that have static typing or dynamic typing are said to be "static typed" or "dynamic typed".
Static Typing
Static typed programming languages are those in which variables need not be defined before they’re used. This implies that static typing has to do with the explicit declaration (or initialization) of variables before they’re employed. Java is an example of a static typed language; C and C++ are also static typed languages. Note that in C (and C++ also), variables can be cast into other types, but they don’t get converted; you just read them assuming they are another type.
Static typing does not imply that you have to declare all the variables first, before you use them; variables maybe be initialized anywhere, but developers have to do so before they use those variables anywhere. Consider the following example:
/* C code */ 
static int num, sum; // explicit declaration 
num = 5; // now use the variables 
sum = 10; 
sum = sum + num;
The above code fragment is an example of how variable declaration in static typed languages generally appears. Note that in the above code, static has nothing to do with static typing; it has been used along with int only to initialize num and sum to zero.
Dynamic Typing
Dynamic typed programming languages are those languages in which variables must necessarily be defined before they are used. This implies that dynamic typed languages do not require the explicit declaration of the variables before they’re used. Python is an example of a dynamic typed programming language, and so is PHP. Consider the following example:
/* Python code */ 
num = 10 // directly using the variable
In the above code fragment, we have directly assigned the variable num the value 10 before initializing it. This is characteristic to dynamic typed programming languages.
Another Analogy
A lot of people define static typing and dynamic typing with respect to the point at which the variable types are checked. Using this analogy, static typed languages are those in which type checking is done at compile-time, whereas dynamic typed languages are those in which type checking is done at run-time.
This analogy leads to the analogy we used above to define static and dynamic typing. I believe it is simpler to understand static and dynamic typing in terms of the need for the explicit declaration of variables, rather than as compile-time and run-time type checking.
Static Typing and Dynamic Typing versus Strong Typing and Weak Typing
Static and dynamic typing, and strong and weak typing, are two totally different concepts, which, unfortunately, are very often confused. It is erroneous to say that a language that is static or dynamic typed cannot be strong or weak typed. Static and dynamic typing, and strong and weak typing, are different forms of classification of programming languages, and one of each class necessarily characterizes a given language. It is thus imperative to discuss strong and weak typing vis-a-vis static and dynamic typing.
Programming languages that exhibit "strong typing" are "strong typed," and those that exhibit "weak typing" are "weak typed".
Strong Typing
Programming languages in which variables have specific data types are strong typed. This implies that in strong typed languages, variables are necessarily bound to a particular data type. Python is strong typed, and so is Java. The distinction between strong typing and weak typing is more subtle and thus more difficult to grasp than is the distinction between static typing and dynamic typing. Consider the following example:
/* Python code */ 
>>> foo = "x" 
>>> foo = foo + 2 
Traceback (most recent call last): 
  File "<pyshell#3>", line 1, in ? 
    foo = foo + 2 
TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects 
>>>
In the above Python example (run from the Python shell), foo is of str type. In the second line, we’re attempting to add 2 (an int) to a variable of str type. As we can see, a TypeError is returned, indicating that a str object cannot be concatenated with an int object. This is what characterizes strong typed languages: variables are bound to a particular data type.
Weak Typing
As opposed to strong typed languages, weak typed languages are those in which variables are not of a specific data type. It should be noted that this does not imply that variables do not have types; it does mean that variables are not "bound" to a specific data type. PHP and C are examples of weak typed languages. Consider the following:
/* PHP code */ 
<?php 
$foo = "x"; 
$foo = $foo + 2; // not an error 
echo $foo; 
?>
In this example, foo is initially a string type. In the second line, we add this string variable to 2, an integer. This is permitted in PHP, and is characteristic of all weak typed languages.
Now that we know about the two concepts, we can augment both of them to characterize any given language. Thus, Python is dynamic typed and strong typed; Java is static typed and strong typed; PHP is dynamic typed and weak typed; C is static typed and weak typed (owing to its casting ability).
Dynamic Typing is Good
In a dynamic typed language, you don’t have to initialize variables, which is a big bonus for many developers. Programmers like the fact that you can use a variable at will when required (without having to initialize it). Dynamic typing is characteristic of many of the scripting languages: Perl, PHP, Python, etc. Dynamic typing, in fact, does save you from writing a few "extra" lines of code, which, in turn, means less time spent writing code.
Or Is It?  



 
The very characteristic of dynamic typed languages that appeals to many developers is also a pitfall, and a major one at that. Consider the following simple example:
/* Python code */ 
my_variable = 10 
while my_variable > 0: 
        i = foo(my_variable) 
        if i < 100: 
                my_variable++ 
        else 
                my_varaible = (my_variable + i) / 10 // spelling error intentional
As you can see in the above code, my_varaible is a spelling mistake that the programmer could have very well made. The problem here is that, since Python is dynamically typed, it will not return an error, but instead will create a new variable called my_varaible. So, now we have two variables: my_variable and my_varaible. This obviously is a serious problem; some would suggest that forced variable declaration is an important requirement in any programming language.
Static Typed Behavior in Dynamic Typed Languages
Perl is a dynamic typed programming language. However, it provides a means to "simulate" static typing by means of a pragma called strict. Consider the following Perl example:
/* Perl code */ 
$sum = 10; 
print $sum;
The above code will run without any problem, and will print 10 to the console. Note that here, we have not initialized the variable sum; this exemplifies the dynamic typing characteristic of Perl. To enforce variable declaration, we make use of the strict pragma as follows:
/* Perl code */ 
use strict; 
$sum = 10; 
print $sum;
The above code fragment will return the following error when you try to run it:
Global symbol "$num" requires explicit package name at perl.pl line 2. 
Execution of perl.pl aborted due to compilation errors.
To rectify the above error, we are forced to declare the variable num as follows:
/* Perl code */ 
use strict; 
my $num; // forced declaration 
$sum = 10; 
print $sum;
The above codes are specific to Perl; not all programming languages have a way to enforce variable declaration: Python, for example doesn’t have a way to enforce variable declaration. However, there is a tool, called "pychecker" (available here), that can be used to "detect" stray variables; this is, of course, far from a desirable solution.
Static Typed or Dynamic Typed?
There are advocates of both forms of typing. Asserting that one is better than the other would only lead to a debate of no consequence.
There are those who advocate dynamic typing for the simplicity and saving in terms of time that it offers; they believe that type checking need not be an integral part of the programming language design per se, but instead, that third-party solutions (like pychecker) could be used to server that purpose.
On the other hand, there are advocates of static typing, who believe that static typing (leading to forced variable declaration) is an important requirement of programming language design.
Conclusion
Static typing and dynamic typing, and strong and weak typing, are topics of programming language design that are not always clearly defined and, as a result, are not very well understood. This article has given you an insight into the concepts of static and dynamic typing as well as strong and weak typing.

Entity Framework için constructor (GITHUB)
Entity Framework için constructor

içine parametre alan bir constructor oluşturmuşsan eğer:

parametresiz bir constructor da oluşturmalısın. Boş kalsın. Neden bunu yapmamız gerekiyor?

Entity framework, User class'ının instance'ını bu parametreli constructor'u kullanarak oluşturamaz da ondan. Bir düşün. Entity framework nasıl instance oluştursun (veya obje initialize etsin) eğer boş bir constructor yoksa?

O yüzden,

Boş ctor oluşturmamız gerekiyor. Bu boş ctor wrong state'e girmemize yol açabilir. Yani boş olan ctor bazı sıkıntılara yol açabilir. O yüzden boş ctor'u protected yapabiliriz. Çok iyi olur.

Navigation Property (GITHUB)
Navigation property nedir
A navigation property is an optional property on an entity type that allows for navigation from one end of an association to the other end. Unlike other properties, navigation properties do not carry data.
A navigation property definition includes the following:
•	A name. (Required)
•	The association that it navigates. (Required)
•	The ends of the association that it navigates. (Required)
Önemli:
Navigation properties are optional on both entity types at the ends of an association. If you define a navigation property on one entity type at the end of an association, you do not have to define a navigation property on the entity type at the other end of the association.
The data type of a navigation property is determined by the multiplicity of its remote association end. For example, suppose a navigation property, OrdersNavProp, exists on a Customer entity type and navigates a one-to-many association between Customer and Order. Because the remote association end for the navigation property has multiplicity of many (*), its data type is a collection (of Order). Similarly, if a navigation property, CustomerNavProp, exists on the Order entity type, its data type would be Customer, because the multiplicity of the remote end is one (1).

ERRORS  (GITHUB)
404: Links that don’t lead anywhere are known as 'dead links' or 'broken links'. The HTTP status code 404 is often referred to as 'error 404', 'HTTP 404', or '404 code'.
The typical trigger for an error 404 message is when website content has been removed or moved to another URL. There are also other reasons why an error message could appear. These include:

The URL or its content (such as files or images) was either deleted or moved (without adjusting any internal links accordingly)
The URL was writtenincorrectly (during the creation process or a redesign), linkedincorrectly, or typed into the browser incorrectly
The server responsible for the website is not running or the connection is broken
The requested domain name can’t be converted to an IP by the domain name system (DNS)
The entered domain name doesn’t exist (anymore)

HTTPGet vs HTTPPost	(GITHUB) 
Httpget nedir httppost nedir
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Un2JTC7tFPI
Videoyu izle…
Get yapınca veriler url ye yazılır. Post ta ise form yollanır… Url ile yollanmaz veri. Message body içinde yollanır.
Get metotlara url'ye yazıp enter yaparak ulaşılır. O yüzden tehlikeli olabilir…
DB'deki değerleri hem Get hem Post ile değiştirebiliriz tabi ki. Ama dediğimiz gibi get ile bunu yapmak tehlikelidir.

HTTPPost method hides information from URL and does not bind data to URL. It is more secure than HttpGet method but it is slower than HttpGet. It is only useful when you are passing sensitive information to the server.
The GET Method
GET is used to request data from a specified resource. 
GET is one of the most common HTTP methods. 
Note that the query string (name/value pairs) is sent in the URL of a GET request: 
/test/demo_form.php?name1=value1&name2=value2
Some other notes on GET requests: 
GET requests can be cached
GET requests remain in the browser history
GET requests can be bookmarked
GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data
GET requests have length restrictions
GET requests are only used to request data (not modify)

The POST Method
POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource. 
The data sent to the server with POST is stored in the request body of the HTTP request: 
POST /test/demo_form.php HTTP/1.1
Host: w3schools.com
name1=value1&name2=value2
(yukarıda request body'nin neye benzediğini görmüş olduk. Get request'lerde request body yoktur. Veri url'den gönderilir)
Some other notes on POST requests:
POST requests are never cached
POST requests do not remain in the browser history
POST requests cannot be bookmarked
POST requests have no restrictions on data length

GET methodu HTTP istekleri arasındaki varsayılan yöntemdir.  GET metodu ile yapılan istekler tarayıcının adres satırında görünür. Sadece belirli boyutta veri gönderileceği zaman kullanılır.
POST metodu ise URL’ de görünmesini istemediğimiz veriler olduğunda kullanılabilir. POST yönteminde gönderebileceğimiz verinin boyutu ile ilgili bir sınır yoktur. Ayrıca gönderdiğimiz parametrelerin adres satırında görünmemesi dolayısıyla GET yöntemine göre daha güvenlidir. HTML form gönderileceği zaman neredeyse her zaman POST yöntemi tercih edilir.
Örnek vermek gerekirse Kisilers tablomuzun olduğu bir proje üzerinde kişi bilgilerini düzenlemek isteyebiliriz. Bunun için genellikle iki Action oluştururuz. Bunlardan biri kişinin ID sini parametre olarak alan gelen ID ye göre kişinin bilgilerini Edit formunda açan Action iken diğeri POST olduğunda yani Kaydet butonuna tıklandığında kullanılacak Actiondur.

public ActionResult Edit(int? id)
{
if (id == null)
{  return new HttpStatusCodeResult(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest);  } 
Kisiler kisiler = db.Kisilers.Find(id);
if (kisiler == null) 
{
return HttpNotFound();
}
return View(kisiler);
} 
Yukarıda ki Action’ da querystring’imiz kisa iken aşağıdakinde Kisilers tablosundaki kolon sayısına göre uzunluğu değişecek bir querystring söz konusu. Ayrıca buradan dönen bilgilerinde adres çubuğunda görünmesini istemediğimiz için POST methodunu kullanırız.

Önemli:
Browsers can cache GET requests, generally on static data, like images or scripts. But you can also allow browsers to cache GET requests to controller actions as well, using [OutputCache] or other similar ways, so if caching is turned on for a GET controller action, it's possible that clicking on a link leading to /Home/Index doesn't actually run the Index method on the server, but rather allows the browser to serve up the page from its own cache.
With this line of thinking, you can safely turn on caching on GET actions in which the data you're serving up doesn't change (or doesn't change often), with the knowledge that your server action won't fire every time.
POSTs won't be cached by the browser, so any POST is guaranteed to make it to the server.

Güzel bir açıklama:
Ignore caching for a moment. Another way of thinking about this is that search engines will store HTTP GET links during their indexing/crawling process, therefore they will show up in search results.
Suppose if your /Home/Index is implemented as GET but it lets say deletes a row in your Database, every time this link shows up on a search engine and somebody clicks it, you will have a delete row, and soon you have a lot deleted rows.

Mutable / Immutable
Mutable nedir, immutable nedir:
Mutable and Immutable ?
In English Language Mutable means "can change" and immutable means "cannot change". The term Immutable Object means that the state of the Object cannot change after its creation. An immutable type sets the property or state of the object as read only because it cannot be modified after it is assigned during initialization.
Is String in .Net immutable ?
Yes, the String in .Net is immutable. The System.String class is an immutable type provided in the .NET framework class library. Since a String is an immutable type, it cannot be modified. When you modify a string you are actually creating a new string object with the desired value.
e.g.
 
The above code will create 1000 new string variables in the memory.
Immutability of strings has positive significance in multithreaded applications because it provides automatic thread safety. Instances of immutable types are inherently thread-safe, because no thread can modify it.
The main drawback of immutable types is that they require more resources than other object types. Because each time it modified, it creates a new one.
The above code segment creates 1000 new string variables. In these type of situations you should use the StringBuilder class, which allows you to modify the text without making new String class instances. StringBuilder is a Mutable type, that means when you alter it , it still holding same data.

Pointer
Pointer nedir?

C# supports pointers in a limited extent. A C# pointer is nothing but a variable that holds the memory address of another type. 

But in C# pointer can only be declared to hold the memory address of value types and arrays. Unlike reference types, pointer types are not tracked by the default garbage collection mechanism. For the same reason pointers are not allowed to point to a reference type or even to a structure type which contains a reference type. We can say that pointers can point to only unmanaged types which includes all basic data types, enum types, other pointer types and structs which contain only unmanaged types.

Stack: static memory allocation, çok hızlı. Allocation compile sırasında olur. Ne kadar memory e ihtiyacın olduğunu kestirebiliyosan Stack kullan.

Heap: Dynamic memory allocation, allocation run time'da olur. Bu memory'e erişim yavaştır. Dependency yoktur sağdaki soldaki elementlere. Yani kolayca silip memory yi boşaltabilirsin. Bu olaylar işi kompleksleştirir ve memorynin neresi boş neresi dolu bilmeyi zorlaştırır. Ne kadar memory e ihtiyacın olduğunu kestiremiyorsan bunu kullan. Üst üste yığma alegorisi. Yığ yığabildiğin kadar. Aynı alegoriden ötürü -> yavaş çalışır --> neyin nerede olduğu belirsiz çünkü üst üste yığıyorsun. Stack ise hızlı çünkü herşey düzgün şeklide üst üste koyuluyor.

Semantics 
semantics nedir, semantic nedir
In programming language theory, semantics is the field concerned with the rigorous mathematical study of the meaning of programming languages. It does so by evaluating the meaning of syntactically valid strings defined by a specific programming language, showing the computation involved. In such a case that the evaluation would be of syntactically invalid strings, the result would be non-computation. Semantics describes the processes a computer follows when executing a program in that specific language. This can be shown by describing the relationship between the input and output of a program, or an explanation of how the program will be executed on a certain platform, hence creating a model of computation.
Formal semantics, for instance, helps to write compilers, better understand what a program is doing, and to prove, e.g., that the following if statement
if 1 == 1 then S1 else S2
has the same effect as S1 alone.
Overview
The field of formal semantics encompasses all of the following:
•	The definition of semantic models
•	The relations between different semantic models
•	The relations between different approaches to meaning
•	The relation between computation and the underlying mathematical structures from fields such as logic, set theory, model theory, category theory, etc.
It has close links with other areas of computer science such as programming language design, type theory, compilers and interpreters, program verification and model checking.

Extension Methods in C#  (GITHUB-UPDATED) (read)
Extension method nedir 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/extension-methods
Extension methods enable you to "add" methods to existing types without creating a new derived type, recompiling, or otherwise modifying the original type. Extension methods are static methods, but they're called as if they were instance methods on the extended type. For client code written in C#, F# and Visual Basic, there's no apparent difference between calling an extension method and the methods defined in a type.
The most common extension methods are the LINQ standard query operators that add query functionality to the existing System.Collections.IEnumerable and System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<T> types. To use the standard query operators, first bring them into scope with a using System.Linq directive. Then any type that implements IEnumerable<T> appears to have instance methods such as GroupBy, OrderBy, Average, and so on. You can see these additional methods in IntelliSense statement completion when you type "dot" after an instance of an IEnumerable<T> type such as List<T> or Array.
OrderBy Example
The following example shows how to call the standard query operator OrderBy method on an array of integers. The expression in parentheses is a lambda expression. Many standard query operators take lambda expressions as parameters, but this isn't a requirement for extension methods. For more information, see Lambda Expressions.
class ExtensionMethods2
{

    static void Main()
    {
        int[] ints = { 10, 45, 15, 39, 21, 26 };
        var result = ints.OrderBy(g => g);
        foreach (var i in result)
        {
            System.Console.Write(i + " ");
        }
    }
}
//Output: 10 15 21 26 39 45
…
The following is the extension method we have created.
public static int myExtensionMethod(this string str) {
   return Int32.Parse(str);
}
Let us see an example wherein we have used extension method.
using System;
using System.Text;
namespace Program {
   public static class Demo {
      public static int myExtensionMethod(this string str) {
         return Int32.Parse(str);
      }
   }
   class Program {
      static void Main(string[] args) {
         string str1 = "565";
         int n = str1.myExtensionMethod();
         Console.WriteLine("Result: {0}", n);
         Console.ReadLine();
      }
   }
}
Output
Result: 565

Detaylı:
Extension methods are defined as static methods but are called by using instance method syntax. Their first parameter specifies which type the method operates on. The parameter is preceded by the this modifier. Extension methods are only in scope when you explicitly import the namespace into your source code with a using directive.
The following example shows an extension method defined for the System.String class. It's defined inside a non-nested, non-generic static class:
C#Copy
namespace ExtensionMethods
{
    public static class MyExtensions
    {
        public static int WordCount(this String str)
        {
            return str.Split(new char[] { ' ', '.', '?' },
                             StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries).Length;
        }
    }
}
The WordCount extension method can be brought into scope with this using directive:
C#Copy
using ExtensionMethods;
And it can be called from an application by using this syntax:
C#Copy
string s = "Hello Extension Methods";
int i = s.WordCount();
You invoke the extension method in your code with instance method syntax. The intermediate language (IL) generated by the compiler translates your code into a call on the static method. The principle of encapsulation is not really being violated. Extension methods cannot access private variables in the type they are extending.

Type Safety / Type Safe		(GITHUB)	 (read)
Type safety nedir, type safe nedir type-safe neir
Type safety means preventing type errors. Type error occurs when data type of one type is assigned to other type UNKNOWINGLY and we get undesirable results.
Type-safety should not be confused with static / dynamic typing or strong / weak typing.

Type safety in .NET has been introduced to prevent the objects of one type from peeking into the memory assigned for the other object. Writing safe code also means to prevent data loss during conversion of one type to another. 
 
What does it exactly means? Suppose I have two types defined as in the following:
1.	public class MyType  
2.	{  
3.	  public int Prop{ get; set;}  
4.	}  
5.	public class YourType  
6.	{  
7.	   public int Prop{get;set;}  
8.	   public int Prop1{get;set;}  
9.	}  
Now suppose, I create an object of MyType as in the following:
1.	MyType obj = new MyType();  
In memory obj would be referencing the 4 bytes of space and suppose next to that part of memory is another string. Now suppose I cast obj to YourType that thankfully is not at all possible in .NET but for a moment imagine that it would have been possible, in that case my code would look something as in the following,
1.	YourType obj1 = (YourType)obj; // Here we will get compile time error  
And suppose, I assign Prop using obj1 reference, as shown below:
1.	obj1.Prop = 10;  
Which is fine but suppose I want to assign value to Prop1 as shown below:
1.	obj1.Prop1 = 20;   
That can lead to some unpredictable results and bugs since this part of memory could be used by the string that I have talked about earlier. From this we can say that type safety comes to our rescue, when the compiler would not allow the casting that we have tried to do. This is a relief for the programmers with a background in unmanaged programming.
 
Now I want to discuss one more scenario in which type safety comes to our rescue. If we are using out or ref with our method parameter and when calling the method our argument does not match the method's parameter, the compiler would not allow the code to compile.
 
Let's take an example for it. I have user type defined as in the following:
1.	public class SomeType  
2.	{  
3.	}  
And I have function that takes a parameter of type object as shown below:
1.	private void ChangeValue(out object par)  
2.	{  
3.	   par = new String('x', 10);  
4.	}  
Now suppose I call the method ChangeValue as in the following that would not of course compile:
1.	SomeType obj = new SomeType();  
2.	ChangeValue(out obj); //compile time error  
If .NET would have allowed this code to execute, type safety could have easily been compromised here.
 
If the ChangeValue function has the parameter without the out keyword, there would not have been any compile time error, since the caller can have an argument type that derives from the parameter type.

If your data is of type X and X doesn't support operation y, then the language will not allow you to to execute y(X).
This definition doesn't set rules on when this is checked. It can be at compile time (static typing) or at runtime (dynamic typing), typically through exceptions. It can be a bit of both: some statically typed languages allow you to cast data from one type to another, and the validity of casts must be checked at runtime (imagine that you're trying to cast an Object to a Consumer - the compiler has no way of knowing whether it's acceptable or not).
Type-safety does not necessarily mean strongly typed, either - some languages are notoriously weakly typed, but still arguably type safe. Take Javascript, for example: its type system is as weak as they come, but still strictly defined. It allows automatic casting of data (say, strings to ints), but within well defined rules. There is to my knowledge no case where a Javascript program will behave in an undefined fashion, and if you're clever enough (I'm not), you should be able to predict what will happen when reading Javascript code.
An example of a type-unsafe programming language is C: reading / writing an array value outside of the array's bounds has an undefined behaviour by specification. It's impossible to predict what will happen. C is a language that has a type system, but is not type safe.

In computer science, type safety is the extent to which a programming language discourages or prevents type errors. A type error is erroneous or undesirable program behaviour caused by a discrepancy between differing data types for the program's constants, variables, and methods (functions), e.g., treating an integer (int) as a floating-point number (float). Type safety is sometimes alternatively considered to be a property of a computer program rather than the language in which that program is written; that is, some languages have type-safe facilities that can be circumvented by programmers who adopt practices that exhibit poor type safety. The formal type-theoretic definition of type safety is considerably stronger than what is understood by most programmers.

int a = 2;
int b = 3;
int c = a * b;
yukarıdaki int c = a * b;  
işlemindeki a ve b değişkenlerine operand denir. 
a değişkeni: sol operand
b değişkeni: sağ operand
Kaynak: aşağıdaki text
+	Adds two operands
-	Subtracts the second operand from the first
*	Multiplies both operands
/	Divides the numerator by de-numerator
%	Modulus Operator and a remainder of after an integer division
++	Increment operator increases integer value by one
--	Decrement operator decreases integer value by one

Relational Operators
These are operators used for performing Relational operations on numbers. Below is the list of relational operators available in C#.
Operator	Description
==	Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true.
!=	Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true.
>	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.
<	Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.
>=	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.

operator
operator nedir, operatör nedir operators nedir, operatörler nedir
+  -  *  / << == >> gibi işaretler operatördür.
Operator in C# is a special symbol that specifies which operations to perform on operands. For example, in mathematics the plus symbol (+) signifies the sum of the left and right numbers. In the same way, C# has many operators that have different meanings based on the data types of the operands. C# operators usually have one or two operands. Operators that have one operand are called Unary operators.
The following table list some of the operators available in C#.
Operator category	Operators
Primary	x.y
Unary	+x
Multiplicative	x * y
Additive	x + y
Shift	x << y
Relational and type testing	x < y
Equality	x == y
Logical AND	x & y
Logical XOR	x ^ y
Logical OR	x | y
Conditional AND	x && y
Conditional OR	x || y
Null-coalescing	x ?? y
Conditional	?:
Assignment and lambda expression	x = y
As mentioned before, certain operators have different meanings based on the datatype of the operand. For example, if the + operator is used with numbers, it will add the numbers but if it is used with strings, it will concatenate the two strings.
When an operator does different things based on the datatype of the operands, it is called operator over loading.
The following C# code shows the use of the + sign operator on different datatypes:

Example: + Operator
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    string message1 = "Hello";

    string message2 = message1 + " World!!";    

    Console.WriteLine(message2);

F# / F Sharp 
Fsharp nedir f sharp nedir f# nedir
F# originates from Microsoft Research, Cambridge, UK. The language was originally designed and implemented by Don Syme,[6] according to whom in the fsharp team, they say the F is for "Fun".[24] Andrew Kennedy contributed to the design of units of measure.[6] The Visual F# Tools for Visual Studio are developed by Microsoft.[6] The F# Software Foundation developed the F# open-source compiler and tools, incorporating the open-source compiler implementation provided by the Microsoft Visual F# Tools team.[11]

F# (pronounced F sharp) is a general purpose, strongly typed, multi-paradigm programming language that encompasses functional, imperative, and object-oriented programming methods. F# is most often used as a cross-platform Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) language, but it can also generate JavaScript[9] and graphics processing unit (GPU) code.[10]

Syntax:
F# da göze çarpan ilk önemli komut "let" dir. Bu komut ile bir değişkene değeri kaydederiz. Örnek: 
let ahmet = 10 <- 19

Operator Overloading
[operator overloading nedir] 

Most operators in C# can be overloaded, meaning they can be redefined for custom actions.
For example, you can redefine the action of the plus (+) operator in a custom class.

class Box
{
    public int Height { get; set; }
    public int Width { get; set; }
    public Box(int h, int w)
    {
        Height = h;
        Width = w;
    }
    public static Box operator +(Box a, Box b) // eksi işareti de kullanılabilirdi. Sonuç değişmez. Operatörle ilgisi yok yani. + - * / hepsi aynı sonuç.
    {
        int h = a.Height + b.Height;
        int w = a.Width + b.Width;
        Box res = new Box(h, w);
        return res;
    }
}
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Box b1 = new Box(14, 3);
    Box b2 = new Box(5, 7);
    Box b3 = b1 + b2;
 
    Console.WriteLine(b3.Height); //19
    Console.WriteLine(b3.Width); //10
    Console.ReadKey();
}

The method  public static Box operator +(Box a, Box b) defines an overloaded operator + with two Box object parameters and returning a new Box object whose Height and Width properties equal the sum of its parameter's corresponding properties.
Additionally, the overloaded operator must be static.

String  	(GITHUB)
String nedir
Note that you do not use the new operator to create a string object except when initializing the string with an array of chars.
Msdn goes here:
A string is an object of type String whose value is text. Internally, the text is stored as a sequential read-only collection of Char objects. There is no null-terminating character at the end of a C# string; therefore a C# string can contain any number of embedded null characters ('\0'). The Length property of a string represents the number of Char objects it contains, not the number of Unicode characters. To access the individual Unicode code points in a string, use the StringInfo object.
string vs. System.String
In C#, the string keyword is an alias for String. Therefore, String and string are equivalent, and you can use whichever naming convention you prefer. 
Declaring and Initializing Strings
You can declare and initialize strings in various ways, as shown in the following example:
(declare nedir örnek, initialization nedir örnek)
// Declare without initializing.
string message1;

// Initialize to null.
string message2 = null;

// Initialize as an empty string.
// Use the Empty constant instead of the literal "".
string message3 = System.String.Empty;

// Initialize with a regular string literal.
string oldPath = "c:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio 8.0";

// Initialize with a verbatim string literal.
string newPath = @"c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0";

// Use System.String if you prefer.
System.String greeting = "Hello World!";

// In local variables (i.e. within a method body)
// you can use implicit typing.
var temp = "I'm still a strongly-typed System.String!";

// Use a const string to prevent 'message4' from
// being used to store another string value.
const string message4 = "You can't get rid of me!";

// Use the String constructor only when creating
// a string from a char*, char[], or sbyte*. See
// System.String documentation for details.
char[] letters = { 'A', 'B', 'C' };
string alphabet = new string(letters);

Note that you do not use the new operator to create a string object except when initializing the string with an array of chars.
Initialize a string with the Empty constant value to create a new String object whose string is of zero length. The string literal representation of a zero-length string is "". By initializing strings with the Empty value instead of null, you can reduce the chances of a NullReferenceException occurring. Use the static IsNullOrEmpty(String) method to verify the value of a string before you try to access it.

Web Server	 (GITHUB)
Web server nedir
Web server ya da ağ sunucusu, internet üzerinde bir web sitesinin yayınından sorumlu olan sunucudur. Web server, Hosting ya da “barındırma” işlemini internet protokolü üzerinden sunan bir sunucudur. Barındırma ya da hosting, Web sayfalarını internette yayınlamak için gerekli alanın kiralanmasıdır. Diğer bir ifade ile hosting, bir Web sitesinde yayınlanmak istenen sayfaların, resimlerin veya dokümanların internet kullanıcıları tarafından erişebileceği bir bilgisayarda tutulmasıdır.
A Web server is software or hardware that uses HTTP and other protocols to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web (WWW). Web server software controls how a user accesses hosted files. It is accessed through the domain names of websites and ensures the delivery of the site's content to the requesting user. As hardware, a Web server is a computer that holds web server software and other files related to a website, such as HTML documents, images and JavaScript files. Web server hardware is connected to the internet and allows data to be exchanged with other connected devices.
The Web server process is an example of the client/server model. All computers that host Web sites must have Web server software. 
Leading Web servers include Apache, Microsoft's Internet Information Server (IIS) and Nginx -- pronounced engine X. Other Web servers include Novell's NetWare server, Google Web Server (GWS) and IBM's family of Domino servers.
Web servers often come as part of a larger package of internet- and intranet-related programs that are used for:
•	Sending and receiving emails.
•	Downloading requests for File Transfer Protocol (FTP) files.
•	Building and publishing Web pages.
Considerations in choosing a Web server include how well it works with the operating system and other servers; its ability to handle server-side programming; security characteristics; and the particular publishing, search engine and site building tools that come with it.
So basically a web server is the software that receives your request to access a web page. It runs a few security checks on your HTTP request and takes you to the web page. Depending on the page you have requested, the page may ask the server to run a few extra modules while generating the document to serve you. It then serves you the document you requested. Pretty awesome isn’t it.
-
A web server is server software, or hardware dedicated to running this software, that can satisfy client requests on the World Wide Web. A web server can, in general, contain one or more websites. A web server processes incoming network requests over HTTP and several other related protocols.
The primary function of a web server is to store, process and deliver web pages to clients.[1] The communication between client and server takes place using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Pages delivered are most frequently HTML documents, which may include images, style sheets and scripts in addition to the text content.
 
Multiple web servers may be used for a high traffic website; here, Dell servers are installed together being used for the Wikimedia Foundation.
A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by making a request for a specific resource using HTTP and the server responds with the content of that resource or an error message if unable to do so. The resource is typically a real file on the server's secondary storage, but this is not necessarily the case and depends on how the web server is implemented.
While the major function is to serve content, a full implementation of HTTP also includes ways of receiving content from clients. This feature is used for submitting web forms, including uploading of files.
Many generic web servers also support server-side scripting using Active Server Pages (ASP), PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor), or other scripting languages. This means that the behaviour of the web server can be scripted in separate files, while the actual server software remains unchanged. Usually, this function is used to generate HTML documents dynamically ("on-the-fly") as opposed to returning static documents. The former is primarily used for retrieving or modifying information from databases. The latter is typically much faster and more easily cached but cannot deliver dynamic content.

Terminal 	(GITHUB)
Terminal nedir

Terminal, Apple bilgisayarları ve Linux işletim sistemi kullanılan bilgisayarların içerisinde yer alan, kullanıcıların bir klavye ve ekran yardımıyla işletim sistemi yada yazılımları kontrol etmesine yardımcı olan komut ekranıdır. 

A terminal is simply a text-based interface to the computer. In a terminal, you can type commands, manipulate files, execute programs, and open documents. When working in a terminal, the current directory is called your working directory. A terminal will usually start in the top-level directory of your account.
Directories are separated by a backslash /. The topmost directory is indicated by a single backslash. The total directory tree is all relative to the top level directory.
On MacOS, there is a Volumes directory at the top that lists all mounted drives (networked or local). So if you have mounted your network directory, the path to it will look like the following if you substitute your username for mine.
/Volumes/Personal/bmaxwell
In a terminal, you generally type a command and any modifiers or arguments the command requires, then hit return and the command is executed. For example, to set your current (working) directory to your home directory, type cd and the prompt and hit return. Below is an example of a terminal and some commands.

Windows PowerShell 	(GITHUB)
Windows powershell nedir

To give you a better understanding of PowerShell, we should first define what a shell is. No, we're not talking about a turtle's shell. :) In computer science, a shell is a user interface that gives you access to various services of an operating system. A shell can be command-line based, or it can include a graphical user interface (GUI).
Windows PowerShell is a shell initially developed by Microsoft for the purposes of task automation and configuration management. PowerShell is now an open source project, and it can be installed on Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. This shell is based on the .NET framework, and it includes a command-line shell and a scripting language.

Windows PowerShell, Microsoft tarafından Windows komut satırı cmd.exe ve Windows Script Host'a alternatif olarak geliştirilen yeni nesil bir komut satırı uygulamasıdır. Windows PowerShell'in sunduğu yeni komut yapısı Unix sistemindeki komut yapısına benzemektedir. Kullanıcı herhangi bir komutu çalıştırdığında farklı komutlar ile bağ kurabilmektedir. Windows PowerShell 30 Kasım 2006'da ilk olarak Windows Vista işletim sisteminin bir parçası olarak planlanmıştır. Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 ile beraber ilk kez piyasaya sürülmüştür. Windows PowerShell 1.0 sürümü Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 ve Windows Vista için ücretsiz indirilebilmektedir. Windows 7'den itibaren Windows PowerShell 2.0 işletim sistemi ile beraber gelmektedir. Windows PowerShell 2.0 bir önceki sürümünden farklı olarak görsel kullanıcı arayüzüne sahptir.

Variable	(GITHUB)
Variable nedir, değişken nedir

Creating a variable reserves a memory location, or a space in memory, for storing values. 
To use a variable, it must first be declared by specifying the name and data type. 
A variable name, also called an identifier, can contain letters, numbers and the underscore character (_) and must start with a letter or underscore. 
For example, firstName and lastName are good descriptive variable names.

Json		(GITHUB)
json nedir
Json türündeki veriler iki parçadan oluşur: key (anahtar) ve value (değer). Anahtar’da nesnenin hangi özelliğinin olduğu (koddaki değişken ismi gibi düşünülebilir) tanımlanırken değerde ise anahtar özelliğinin değeri (değişkenin değeri) tanımlanır. Nesnelerdeki anahtar ve değerler string türünde tanımlanır. Aşağıda basit bir json nesnesi örneği bulunmaktadır.
{
   "Ad": "Veysel Uğur",
   "Soyad": "Kızmaz"
}


Detay:

What Is JSON?
JSON is short for JavaScript Object Notation, and is a way to store information in an organized, easy-to-access manner. In a nutshell, it gives us a human-readable collection of data that we can access in a really logical manner.
Storing JSON Data
As a simple example, information about me might be written in JSON as follows:
	var jason = {
		"age" : "24",
		"hometown" : "Missoula, MT",
		"gender" : "male"
	};
view rawgistfile1.js hosted with   by GitHub
This creates an object that we access using the variable jason. By enclosing the variable’s value in curly braces, we’re indicating that the value is an object. Inside the object, we can declare any number of properties using a "name": "value" pairing, separated by commas. To access the information stored in jason, we can simply refer to the name of the property we need. For instance, to access information about me, we could use the following snippets:
	document.write('Jason is ' jason.age); // Output: Jason is 24
	document.write('Jason is a ' jason.gender); // Output: Jason is a male
view rawgistfile1.js hosted with   by GitHub
Storing JSON Data in Arrays
A slightly more complicated example involves storing two people in one variable. To do this, we enclose multiple objects in square brackets, which signifies an array. For instance, if I needed to include information about myself and my brother in one variable, I might use the following:
	var family = [{
	    "name" : "Jason",
	    "age" : "24",
	    "gender" : "male"
	},
	{
	    "name" : "Kyle",
	    "age" : "21",
	    "gender" : "male"
	}];
view rawgistfile1.js hosted with   by GitHub
To access this information, we need to access the array index of the person we wish to access. For example, we would use the following snippet to access info stored in family:
	document.write(family[1].name); // Output: Kyle
	document.write(family[0].age); // Output: 24
view rawgistfile1.js hosted with   by GitHub
NOTE: This is beneficial if it will be necessary to loop through stored information, as it lends itself to a for loop with an automatically incrementing value.
Nesting JSON Data
Another way to store multiple people in our variable would be to nest objects. To do this, we would create something similar to the following:
	var family = {
	    "jason" : {
	        "name" : "Jason Lengstorf",
	        "age" : "24",
	        "gender" : "male"
	    },
	    "kyle" : {
	        "name" : "Kyle Lengstorf",
	        "age" : "21",
	        "gender" : "male"
	    }
	}
view rawgistfile1.js hosted with   by GitHub
Accessing information in nested objects is a little easier to understand; to access information in the object, we would use the following snippet:
	document.write(family.jason.name); // Output: Jason Lengstorf
	document.write(family.kyle.age); // Output: 21
	document.write(family.jason.gender); // Output: male
view rawgistfile1.js hosted with   by GitHub
Nested JSON and arrays can be combined as needed to store as much data as necessary.
Why Does JSON Matter?
With the rise of AJAX-powered sites, it’s becoming more and more important for sites to be able to load data quickly and asynchronously, or in the background without delaying page rendering. Switching up the contents of a certain element within our layouts without requiring a page refresh adds a “wow” factor to our applications, not to mention the added convenience for our users. Because of the popularity and ease of social media, many sites rely on the content provided by sites such as Twitter, Flickr, and others. These sites provide RSS feeds, which are easy to import and use on the server-side, but if we try to load them with AJAX, we run into a wall: we can only load an RSS feed if we’re requesting it from the same domain it’s hosted on. An attempt to load my Flickr account’s RSS feed via jQuery’s $.ajax() method results in the following JavaScript error:
	[Exception... "Access to restricted URI denied" code: "1012" 
	nsresult: "0x805303f4 (NS_ERROR_DOM_BAD_URI)" 
	location: "http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3.2/jquery.min.js Line: 19"]
view rawgistfile1.js hosted with   by GitHub
JSON allows us to overcome the cross-domain issue because we can use a method called JSONP that uses a callback function to send the JSON data back to our domain. It’s this capability that makes JSON so incredibly useful, as it opens up a lot of doors that were previously difficult to work around.
How Do We Load JSON into a Project?
One of the easiest ways to load JSON data into our web applications is to use the $.ajax() method available in the jQuery library. The ease of retrieving data will vary based on the site providing the data, but a simple example might look like this:
	$.ajax(
	    type:'GET',
	    url:"http://example.com/users/feeds/",
	    data:"format=json&id=123",
	    success:function(feed) {
	        document.write(feed);
	    },
	    dataType:'jsonp'
	);
view rawgistfile1.js hosted with   by GitHub
This example would request the latest feed items in JSON format and output them to the browser. Obviously, we wouldn’t want to output raw JSON data to the browser, but this example shows the basics of loading JSON from an external source.
A Practical Example: Loading Flickr Streams with JSON and jQuery
[demolink]See the Demo | Download the Source[/demolink]
To show how JSON works in a real-world example, let’s load photos from Flickr using jQuery and the JSON version of Flickr’s “Latest” photo feed.
Step 1: Create the AJAX Request
Flickr’s photostream feeds are relatively easy to access. All users have a unique ID number, which we will send as part of the request to this URL.
	http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne
view rawgistfile1.html hosted with   by GitHub
The request we need to send asks for the latest photos from the user in question, along with flags asking for a JSON-formatted response. The request we need to send will look like this:
	id=XXXXXXXX@NXX&lang=en-us&format=json&jsoncallback=?
view rawgistfile1.html hosted with   by GitHub
In the above example, XXXXXXXX@NXX needs to be replaced with the user’s ID. We’ll be writing a function, so the user’s ID will be passed as an argument called flickrID. Our function will be called loadFlickr(). Let’s create the function that will load our JSON response:
	function loadFlickr(flickrid)
	{
	    $('#feed').html('<span><img src="/blog/images/lightbox-ico-loading.gif" alt=""></span>');
	    $.ajax({
	        type:'GET',
	        url:"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne",
	        data:"id="+flickrid+"&lang=en-us&format=json&jsoncallback=?",
	        success:function(feed) {
	            // Do something with the response
	        },
	        dataType:'jsonp'
	    });
	}
view rawgistfile1.js hosted with   by GitHub
The returned JSON data will look something like this (note that I’ve removed all but one of the returned photos for the sake of brevity):
	({
	    "title": "Uploads from ennuidesign",
	    "link": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/ennuidesign/",

	    }
	 
	    // The rest of the photo entries go here...
	 
	    ]
	})
view rawgistfile1.json hosted with   by GitHub
Step 2: Process the JSON Data
What we’re going to do is display the thumbnails of the latest 16 photos, which will link to the medium-sized display of the image. The Flickr JSON is a little confusing, and it doesn’t provide a direct link to the thumbnail version of our photos, so we’ll have to use some trickery on our end to get to it, which we’ll cover in just a moment. Each photo entry is stored in an array called items, which we access in our AJAX call using feed.items. To get to the data about each entry, we’ll loop through the items until we’ve either hit the last available photo or 16 total photos; whichever comes first. Let’s modify our function and set up the loop:
	function loadFlickr(flickrid)

The element we’re interested in is the “m” element stored within the “media” element. This can be accessed within our loop using feed.items[i].media.m. We’re going to run a regular expression on this value to get both the medium and thumbnail image paths, which we’ll assemble into a linked thumbnail image. Then, we’ll push the newly assembled HTML into the array of thumbs we created. After we’ve finished the loop, we’ll combine all the images into one string of HTML and replace the contents of our display element with the loaded thumbnails. Let’s add this functionality to our script:
	function loadFlickr(flickrid)
	{
	    // Display a loading icon in our display element
	    $('#feed').html('<span><img src="/blog/images/lightbox-ico-loading.gif" alt=""></span>');
	 
	    // Request the JSON and process it
	    $.ajax({
	        type:'GET',
	        url:"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne",
	        data:"id="+flickrid+"&lang=en-us&format=json&jsoncallback=?",
	        success:function(feed) {
	            // Create an empty array to store images
	            var thumbs = [];
	 
	            // Loop through the items
	            for(var i=0, l=feed.items.length; i < l && i < 16;   i) 
	            {
	                // Manipulate the image to get thumb and medium sizes
	                var img = feed.items[i].media.m.replace(
	                    /^(.*?)_m.jpg$/, 
	                    '<a href="/blog/$1.jpg"><img src="/blog/$1_s.jpg" alt=""></a>'
	                );
	 
	                // Add the new element to the array
	                thumbs.push(img);
	            }
	 
	            // Display the thumbnails on the page
	            $('#feed').html(thumbs.join(''));
	 
	            // A function to add a lightbox effect
	            addLB();
	        },
	        dataType:'jsonp'
	    });
	}

Note that I’ve also added a function called addLB() to the end of this function; this adds the lightbox effect to our thumbnails, which is purely for aesthetics.
Step 3: Call Our Function
At this point, we’re ready to call our function. To load my Flickr stream, we would need to call our function as follows:
	loadFlickr("29080075@N02");

The example posted will pull multiple users’ photostreams into the containing box without causing a page refresh. Look at the source code on the demo to see how it was done. NOTE: Keep in mind that this demo was to show how to load JSON data, and not on how to implement the code to call the function. The JavaScript calls are inline, which should NOT be used in a production script.

SharePoint 
sharepoint nedir
SharePoint is a web-based collaborative platform that integrates with Microsoft Office. Launched in 2001, SharePoint is primarily sold as a document management and storage system, but the product is highly configurable and usage varies substantially among organizations.
Microsoft states that SharePoint has 190 million users across 200,000 customer organizations.
There are the Windows SharePoint Services (WSS), the Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) and Microsoft Search Server. Each bring their own functionalities to the table and build upon each other. 
When looking up what SharePoint is, you get a lot of different answers from the Internet:
•	Microsoft SharePoint is a browser-based collaboration and document management platform from Microsoft - Wikipedia
•	Microsoft's content management system. It allows groups to set up a centralized, password protected space for document sharing. Documents can be stored, downloaded and edited, then uploaded for continued sharing. - SAIT Polytechnic Teaching - Glossary
•	SharePoint is a web-based intranet that can help improve your organization's effectiveness by streamlining the management of and access to data. - Creative SharePoint
•	SharePoint is an enterprise information portal, from Microsoft, that can be configured to run Intranet, Extranet and Internet sites. - SharePoint HQ
•	{..} SharePoint is a sort of sharing/blogging/wiki-style server that mainly provides a back end to Microsoft Office - Jack Schofield, Technical Writer Guardian newspaper, UK.
So what is SharePoint? Let's first look at it from a technical perspective. There are the Windows SharePoint Services (WSS), the Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) and Microsoft Search Server. Each bring their own functionality to the table and build upon each other.
Windows SharePoint Services function the basic functionality that Gartner calls Basic Content Services. It offers the user access to Versioning and Check-in/Checkout functionality. WSS can then be extended through the use of the applets to add additional collaborative functions like email alerts, shared calendars, etc.
Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) sits on top of WSS and adds additional features, both to the underlying WSS layer as well as additional ways for the end-user to interact with the repository. The data resides in a SQL Database. Using Webparts it can then present this information to the user using a wide range of different modules and for interaction in different business scenarios. These include such diverse applications as Collaboration, Document management, Records Management (including DOD 5015.2 certified components), Workflow, Personalization, more complex metadata models as well as Blogs and Wikis from the Web 2.0 side.

Difference between readonly and const keyword in C#  	 (GITHUB)
const nedir, readonly nedir  
In C#, a const keyword is used to declare constant fields and constant local. The value of the constant field is the same throughout the program or in other words, once the constant field is assigned the value of this field is not be changed. In C#, constant fields and locals are not variables, a constant is a number, string, null reference, boolean values.

Example:
// C# program to illustrate the 
// use of const keyword 
using System; 
  
class GFG { 
  
    // Constant fields 
    public const int myvar = 10; 
    public const string str = "GeeksforGeeks"; 
  
    // Main method 
    static public void Main() 
    { 
  
        // Display the value of Constant fields 
        Console.WriteLine("The value of myvar: {0}", myvar); 
        Console.WriteLine("The value of str: {0}", str); 
    } 
} 
Output:



The value of myvar: 10
The value of str: GeeksforGeeks
In C#, you can use a readonly keyword to declare a readonly variable. This readonly keyword shows that you can assign the variable only when you declare a variable or in a constructor of the same class in which it is declared.
Example:
filter_none
edit
play_arrow
brightness_4
// C# program to illustrate the use  
// of the readonly keyword 
using System; 
  
class GFG { 
  
    // readonly variables 
    public readonly int myvar1; 
    public readonly int myvar2; 
  
    // Values of the readonly  
    // variables are assigned 
    // Using constructor 
    public GFG(int b, int c) 
    { 
  
        myvar1 = b; 
        myvar2 = c; 
        Console.WriteLine("Display value of myvar1 {0}, "+ 
                        "and myvar2 {1}", myvar1, myvar2); 
    } 
  
    // Main method 
    static public void Main() 
    { 
        GFG obj1 = new GFG(100, 200); 
    } 
} 
Output:
Display value of myvar1 100, and myvar2 200

readonly Modifier

[readonly nedir, readonly modifier nedir, readonly keyword nedir, const nedir]

The readonly modifier prevents a member of a class from being modified after construction. It means that the field declared as readonly can be modified only when you declare it or from within a constructor.

        class Person
        {
            private readonly string name = "John";
            public Person(string name)
            {
                this.name = name;
            }
        }
If we try to modify the name field anywhere else, we will get an error.

There are three major differences between readonly and const fields. 
First, a constant field must be initialized when it is declared, whereas a readonly field can be declared without initialization, as in:

        readonly string name; // OK
        const double PI; // Error
 
Second, a readonly field value can be changed in a constructor, but a constant value cannot.
Third, the readonly field can be assigned a value that is a result of a calculation, but constants cannot, as in:

        readonly double a = Math.Sin(60); // OK
        const double b = Math.Sin(60); // Error

this Keyword	    (GITHUB)

this nedir, this keyword nedir
The this keyword is used inside the class and refers to the current instance of the class, meaning it refers to the current object.
One of the common uses of this is to distinguish class members from other data, such as local or formal parameters of a method, as shown in the following example:
        class Person
        {
            private string name;
            public Person(string name)
            {
                this.name = name; // member of the class
            }
        }

Here, this.name represents the member of the class, whereas name represents the parameter of the constructor.

Another common use of this is for passing the current instance to a method as parameter: ShowPersonInfo(this);

Initialization (GITHUB)
Initialization nedir
Object'in property'lerini objenin creation time'ında Set etmeye yarar. Yani objeyi üretirken property'lerini set etmeye yarayan bir şeydir (neydir? Bir Special Feature'dir [pluralsight]

        public class Employee
        {

        }

        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Employee emp = new Employee(); // null dönmeyecektir.. initialize ettik. Constructor kullandık. Ne olmuş oldu? emp üretilmiş oldu... Hatırlayalım ki constructor kullanıldığı zaman yeni obje (instance) üretilmiş olur.
            Employee emp2; // null dönecektir.

            Console.WriteLine(emp); // hata üretmez
            Console.WriteLine(emp2); // HATA! Might not be initialized before accessing.

            Console.ReadLine();
	}
Initialization MSDN anlatımı:
Local variables in C# must be initialized before they are used. For example, you might declare a local variable without initialization as in the following example:
            int myInt; // Declaration
You cannot use it before you initialize it. You can initialize it using the following statement:
            myInt = new int();  // Initialization // Invoke default constructor for int type.
This statement is equivalent to the following statement:

            myInt = 0;         // Assign an initial value, 0 in this example.  
You can, of course, have the declaration and the initialization in the same statement as in the following examples:
            int myInt = new int(); // declaration and the initialization
–or–
            int myInt = 0; // declaration and the initialization
Using the new operator calls the default constructor of the specific type and assigns the default value to the variable. In the preceding example, the default constructor assigned the value 0 to myInt. For more information about values assigned by calling default constructors, see Default Values Table.
With user-defined types, use new to invoke the default constructor. For example, the following statement invokes the default constructor of the Point struct: 

            Point p = new Point(); // Invoke default constructor for the struct.  

After this call, the struct is considered to be definitely assigned; that is, all its members are initialized to their default values.
Örnek:
  int myInt = new int(); // 0 dönüyor
            int otherInt; // 0 dönüyor //initialize etmediğimiz halde 0 değerini aldı. String'de null değer alabildi. Neden int null alamadı? Cevabı aşağıdaki notta: Reference type value type olayı!
            //int otherInt2 = null; // hata verir. Cannot convert null to int.

            //string myString = new string(); // böyle bir şey yazamazsın. Hata verir.
            string otherString; // null dönüyor
            string otherString2 = null; // null dönüyor

// int is a primitive type and only ReferenceTypes (objects) are nullable.
// not2: An int is a value type. It is really of type Int32. Objects that can be nullable are reference types. At a basic level the difference is that a value type will store the value with the variable where a reference type will store a reference to the value. A reference can be null, meaning that it doesn't point to a value. Where a value type always has a value.
Nullable wraps a value type to allow you to have the option of being null. Using int? is just a compiler shortcut to declare a nullable type.
// not3: int is a value type, which can only hold a value...

ArrayList Class  (GITHUB)
arrayList nedir
Implements the IList interface using an array whose size is dynamically increased as required.
The following example shows how to create and initialize an ArrayList and how to display its values.
using System;
using System.Collections;
public class SamplesArrayList  {

   public static void Main()  {

      // Creates and initializes a new ArrayList.
      ArrayList myAL = new ArrayList();
      myAL.Add("Hello");
      myAL.Add("World");
      myAL.Add("!");

      // Displays the properties and values of the ArrayList.
      Console.WriteLine( "myAL" );
      Console.WriteLine( "    Count:    {0}", myAL.Count );
      Console.WriteLine( "    Capacity: {0}", myAL.Capacity );
      Console.Write( "    Values:" );
      PrintValues( myAL );
   }

   public static void PrintValues( IEnumerable myList )  {
      foreach ( Object obj in myList )
         Console.Write( "   {0}", obj );
      Console.WriteLine();
   }

}


/* 
This code produces output similar to the following:

myAL
    Count:    3
    Capacity: 4
    Values:   Hello   World   !

*/

 Important
We don't recommend that you use the ArrayList class for new development. Instead, we recommend that you use the generic List<T> class. The ArrayList class is designed to hold heterogeneous collections of objects. However, it does not always offer the best performance. Instead, we recommend the following:
•	For a heterogeneous collection of objects, use the List<Object> (in C#) or List(Of Object) (in Visual Basic) type.
•	For a homogeneous collection of objects, use the List<T> class.
See Performance Considerations in the List<T> reference topic for a discussion of the relative performance of these classes. See Non-generic collections shouldn't be used on GitHub for general information on the use of generic instead of non-generic collection types.
The ArrayList is not guaranteed to be sorted. You must sort the ArrayList by calling its Sort method prior to performing operations (such as BinarySearch) that require the ArrayList to be sorted. To maintain a collection that is automatically sorted as new elements are added, you can use the SortedSet<T> class.
The capacity of an ArrayList is the number of elements the ArrayList can hold. As elements are added to an ArrayList, the capacity is automatically increased as required through reallocation. The capacity can be decreased by calling TrimToSize or by setting the Capacity property explicitly.
.NET Framework only: For very large ArrayList objects, you can increase the maximum capacity to 2 billion elements on a 64-bit system by setting the enabled attribute of the <gcAllowVeryLargeObjects> configuration element to true in the run-time environment.
Elements in this collection can be accessed using an integer index. Indexes in this collection are zero-based.
The ArrayList collection accepts null as a valid value. It also allows duplicate elements.
Using multidimensional arrays as elements in an ArrayList collection is not supported.

Strongly Typed 	(GITHUB)
Strongly Typed nedir? Strongly type nedir, weakly typed nedir, loosely typed nedir
A LANGUAGE IS STRONGLY TYPED if the compiler can guarantee that the accepted programs will execute without type errors. Lisp languages are usually weakly typed:

C# is a strongly-typed language. It means we must declare the type of a variable which indicates the kind of values it is going to store such as integer, float, decimal, text, etc.
The following declares and initialized variables of different data types.
Example: Variables of Different Data Types

string stringVar = "Hello World!!";
int intVar = 100;
float floatVar = 10.2f;
char charVar = 'A';
bool boolVar = true;
 
In computer programming, programming languages are often colloquially classified as to whether the language's type system makes it strongly typed or weakly typed (loosely typed). Generally, a strongly typed language has stricter typing rules at compile time, which implies that errors and exceptions are more likely to happen during compilation. However, dynamically typed languages (where type checking happens at run time) can also be strongly typed. Most of these rules affect variable assignment, return values and function calling. On the other hand, a weakly typed language has looser typing rules and may produce unpredictable results or may perform implicit type conversion at runtime.[1] A different but related concept is latent typing.

Declarative Programming / Imperative Programming  (GITHUB)

Declarative nedir, imperative nedir, declarative programming nedir, imperative programming nedir

In computer science, declarative programming is a programming paradigm that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.

Declarative programming is when you say what you want, and imperative language is when you say how to get what you want.


İmperative: Emir verebilirsin


Imperative programming, anlaşılacağı üzere Emirli. 

Imperative: NASIL yapacağım diye sorar. Kontrol akışı vardır.

Declarative: NE yapacağım diye sorar. Kontrol akışı tanımlamaz, direk computation’a odaklanır.

Stack Nedir
Videoyu izle: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlzAtIHFRk0
 
Resmi incele.

Value type olanlar (örneğin int) ---> Stack içinde saklanır.
Pointer'lar da Stack içinde saklanır.
Ama objeler Heap içinde saklanır.

Yani neymiş, örneğin Report report = new Report(); deyince; buradaki report, (YANİ OBJE DEĞİL, POINTER!) -- STACK içinde tutuluyor. AMA report aracılığıyla üretilen yeni OBJE HEAP'TE TUTULUYOR. Güzel bilgi bu… 
Dikkat et… report dediğin şey bir pointer'dir, objenin kendisi değildir. Inıtialize yapıyorsan bu pointer gidip bir OBJE üretecektir. Ama kendisi, yani report, o yeni üretilen objeye işaret eden bir pointer'dir.

Report report2 = report; deyince görüldüğü üzere yeni bir obje üretmedik. Zaten initialization olmadığı belli… new Report(); deyip constructor çalıştırmadık veya bir property'sine bir değer atamadık. Yani yeni bir obje oluşmamış oldu. Yani aynı referansı tutuyor report ile…..

SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) Principles    (GITHUB)
Soa nedir, service oriented architecture nedir
SOA is based on some key principles which are mentioned below
1.	Standardized Service Contract - Services adhere to a service description. A service must have some sort of description which describes what the service is about. This makes it easier for client applications to understand what the service does.
2.	Loose Coupling – (geniş bir yere yayılmış insanlar düşün, yani birbirlerinden uzaklar, birbirlerine bağımlı değiller). Less dependency on each other. This is one of the main characteristics of web services which just states that there should be as less dependency as possible between the web services and the client invoking the web service. So if the service functionality changes at any point in time, it should not break the client application or stop it from working.
3.	Service Abstraction - Services hide the logic they encapsulate from the outside world. The service should not expose how it executes its functionality; it should just tell the client application on what it does and not on how it does it.
4.	Service Reusability - Logic is divided into services with the intent of maximizing reuse. In any development company re-usability is a big topic because obviously one wouldn't want to spend time and effort building the same code again and again across multiple applications which require them. Hence, once the code for a web service is written it should have the ability work with various application types.
5.	Service Autonomy - Services should have control over the logic they encapsulate. The service knows everything on what functionality it offers and hence should also have complete control over the code it contains.
6.	Service Statelessness - Ideally, services should be stateless. This means that services should not withhold information from one state to the other. This would need to be done from either the client application. An example can be an order placed on a shopping site. Now you can have a web service which gives you the price of a particular item. But if the items are added to a shopping cart and the web page navigates to the page where you do the payment, the responsibility of the price of the item to be transferred to the payment page should not be done by the web service. Instead, it needs to be done by the web application.
7.	Service Discoverability - Services can be discovered (usually in a service registry). We have already seen this in the concept of the UDDI, which performs a registry which can hold information about the web service.
8.	Service Composability - Services break big problems into little problems. One should never embed all functionality of an application into one single service but instead, break the service down into modules each with a separate business functionality.
9.	Service Interoperability - Services should use standards that allow diverse subscribers to use the service. In web services, standards as XML and communication over HTTP is used to ensure it conforms to this principle.

Stack
Stack nedir

Stack bir data tipidir; ama abstract bir data tipidir.

In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations:
•	push, which adds an element to the collection, and
•	pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.
 
Örnek:

Stack myStack = new Stack();
myStack.Push("Hello!!");
myStack.Push(null);
myStack.Push(1);
myStack.Push(2);

In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. 

Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.
The term is often used in contrast to declarative programming, which focuses on what the program should accomplish without specifying how the program should achieve the result.

In computer science, declarative programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow. 

Declarative Programming devam: Many languages that apply this style attempt to minimize or eliminate side effects by describing what the program must accomplish in terms of the problem domain, rather than describe how to accomplish it as a sequence of the programming language primitives[2](the how being left up to the language's implementation). This is in contrast with imperative programming, which implements algorithms in explicit steps.

Declarative Query Languages: Definition and Examples (GITHUB)

Some well-known general declarative programming languages include Ruby, R and Haskell. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a declarative query language and is the industry standard for relational databases.
Declarative query nedir, declarative query language nedir
The two main paradigms of database query languages are imperative and declarative. Understanding the difference between these two approaches is essential if you’re going to be successful in database development.

If the query languages were human archetypes, imperative languages would be the micromanaging boss who gives instructions down to the final detail.

In the most basic sense, imperative query languages are used to describe how you want something done specifically. This is accomplished with explicit control in a detailed, step-by step manner; the sequence and wording of each line of code plays a critical role.

Some well-known general imperative programming languages include Python, C and Java.

In the world of graph database technology, there aren’t any purely imperative query languages. However, both Gremlin and the Java API (for Neo4j) include imperative features. These two options provide you with more detailed power over the execution of their task. If written correctly, there are no surprises – you will get exactly what you want done.

However, imperative database query languages can also be limiting and not very user-friendly, requiring an extensive knowledge of the language and deep technical understanding of physical implementation details prior to usage. Writing one part incorrectly creates faulty outcomes.

As a result, imperative languages are more prone to human error. Additionally, users must double-check the environment before and after the query and be prepared to deal with any potential erroneous scenarios.

To better illustrate the differences, imagine you have two children: Isabel and Duncan. Isabel represents an imperative query language and Duncan the declarative query language.

To get the two children to make their beds, you take differing approaches. For Duncan, it is easy. Simply instruct Duncan to make his bed and he will do it however he sees fit. Yet, he might make it differently than you had in mind, especially if you’re a picky parent.

Isabel requires an entirely different process. You must first inform her that she needs both sheets and blankets to make her bed, and that those materials are found on top of her bed. Then she requires step-by-step instructions, such as “spread the sheet over the mattress” and “tuck in the edges.”

The final result will be closely similar to Duncan’s (or perhaps, exactly the same). At the end of the process, both children have their beds made.

Declarative Query Languages: Definition and Examples

All too often, declarative query languages are often defined as being any database query language that is not imperative. However, to define it in such a manner is too broad.

Declarative query languages let users express what data to retrieve, letting the engine underneath take care of seamlessly retrieving it. They function in a more general manner and involve giving broad instructions about what task is to be completed, rather than the specifics on how to complete it. They deal with the results rather than the process, focusing less on the finer details of each task.

Some well-known general declarative programming languages include Ruby, R and Haskell. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a declarative query language and is the industry standard for relational databases.

Using a declarative database query language may also result in better code than what can be created manually, and it is usually easier to understand the purpose of the code written in a declarative language. Declarative query languages are also easier to use as they simply focus on what must be retrieved and do so quickly.

However, declarative languages have their own trade-offs. Users have little to no control over how inputs are dealt with; if there is a bug in the language, the user will have to rely on the providers of the language to fix the problem. Likewise, if the user wants to use a function that the query language doesn’t support, they are often at a loss.

In the previous example of the children, Duncan was able to complete his task in a method faster and easier for his parent than Isabel. However, imagine now that you want to them to wash the dishes.

It is the same process for Isabel: You’d need to walk through each step with her so she can learn how the process works.

For Duncan, however, we have hit a snag. Duncan has never learned how to wash the dishes. You will stay in that impasse with Duncan unless his programming engineers decide to teach him how to wash the dishes. (Duncan isn’t like most children.)

Conclusion

You should select the best query language paradigm for your specific use case. Neither paradigm is better than the other; they each have different strengths for software development.

If your project requires finer accuracy and control, imperative query languages do the job well. If the speed and productivity of the development process matter more, declarative languages offer the flexibility of getting results without as much effort. Ultimately, the choice depends on you.

LINQ  (GITHUB)
Linq nedir
Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) is the name for a set of technologies based on the integration of query capabilities directly into the C# language. Traditionally, queries against data are expressed as simple strings without type checking at compile time or IntelliSense support. Furthermore, you have to learn a different query language for each type of data source: SQL databases, XML documents, various Web services, and so on. With LINQ, a query is a first-class language construct, just like classes, methods, events. You write queries against strongly typed collections of objects by using language keywords and familiar operators. The LINQ family of technologies provides a consistent query experience for objects (LINQ to Objects), relational databases (LINQ to SQL), and XML (LINQ to XML).
For a developer who writes queries, the most visible "language-integrated" part of LINQ is the query expression. Query expressions are written in a declarative query syntax. By using query syntax, you can perform filtering, ordering, and grouping operations on data sources with a minimum of code. You use the same basic query expression patterns to query and transform data in SQL databases, ADO .NET Datasets, XML documents and streams, and .NET collections.
You can write LINQ queries in C# for SQL Server databases, XML documents, ADO.NET Datasets, and any collection of objects that supports IEnumerable or the generic IEnumerable<T> interface. LINQ support is also provided by third parties for many Web services and other database implementations.
The following example shows the complete query operation. The complete operation includes creating a data source, defining the query expression, and executing the query in a foreach statement.
C#Copy
class LINQQueryExpressions
{
    static void Main()
    {
        
        // Specify the data source.
        int[] scores = new int[] { 97, 92, 81, 60 };

        // Define the query expression.
        IEnumerable<int> scoreQuery =
            from score in scores
            where score > 80
            select score;

        // Execute the query.
        foreach (int i in scoreQuery)
        {
            Console.Write(i + " ");
        }            
    }
}
// Output: 97 92 81
The following illustration from Visual Studio shows a partially-completed LINQ query against a SQL Server database in both C# and Visual Basic with full type checking and IntelliSense support:
 
Query expression overview
•	Query expressions can be used to query and to transform data from any LINQ-enabled data source. For example, a single query can retrieve data from a SQL database, and produce an XML stream as output.
•	Query expressions are easy to master because they use many familiar C# language constructs.
•	The variables in a query expression are all strongly typed, although in many cases you do not have to provide the type explicitly because the compiler can infer it. For more information, see Type relationships in LINQ query operations.
•	A query is not executed until you iterate over the query variable, for example, in a foreach statement. For more information, see Introduction to LINQ queries.
•	At compile time, query expressions are converted to Standard Query Operator method calls according to the rules set forth in the C# specification. Any query that can be expressed by using query syntax can also be expressed by using method syntax. However, in most cases query syntax is more readable and concise. For more information, see C# language specification and Standard query operators overview.
•	As a rule when you write LINQ queries, we recommend that you use query syntax whenever possible and method syntax whenever necessary. There is no semantic or performance difference between the two different forms. Query expressions are often more readable than equivalent expressions written in method syntax.
•	Some query operations, such as Count or Max, have no equivalent query expression clause and must therefore be expressed as a method call. Method syntax can be combined with query syntax in various ways. For more information, see Query syntax and method syntax in LINQ.
•	Query expressions can be compiled to expression trees or to delegates, depending on the type that the query is applied to. IEnumerable<T> queries are compiled to delegates. IQueryable and IQueryable<T> queries are compiled to expression trees. For more information, see Expression trees.

Runtime vs Compile time
Runtime nedir, compile time nedir,  run time nedir, compile nedir
Runtime and compile time are programming terms that refer to different stages of software program development. Compile-time is the instance where the code you entered is converted to executable while Run-time is the instance where the executable is running. The terms "runtime" and "compile time" are often used by programmers to refer to different types of errors too.
Compile-time checking occurs during the compile time. Compile time errors are error occurred due to typing mistake, if we do not follow the proper syntax and semantics of any programming language then compile time errors are thrown by the compiler. They wont let your program to execute a single line until you remove all the syntax errors or until you debug the compile time errors. The following are usual compile time errors:
	Syntax errors
	Typechecking errors
	Compiler crashes (Rarely)
Run-time type checking happens during run time of programs. Runtime errors are the errors that are generated when the program is in running state. These types of errors will cause your program to behave unexpectedly or may even kill your program. They are often referred as Exceptions . The following are some usual runtime errors:
	Division by zero
	Dereferencing a null pointer
	Running out of memory

Stateless - Stateful
stateless nedir, stateful nedir
Stateful and stateless are adjectives that describe whether a computer or computer program is designed to note and remember one or more preceding events in a given sequence of interactions with a user, another computer or program, a device, or other outside element. 
Stateful means the computer or program keeps track of the state of interaction, usually by setting values in a storage field designated for that purpose. 
Stateless means there is no record of previous interactions and each interaction request has to be handled based entirely on information that comes with it. 
Stateful and stateless are derived from the usage of state as a set of conditions at a moment in time. (Computers are inherently stateful in operation, so these terms are used in the context of a particular set of interactions, not of how computers work in general.)
The Internet's basic protocol, the Internet Protocol ( IP ), is an example of a stateless interaction. Each packet travels entirely on its own without reference to any other packet. When you request a Web page from a Web site, the request travels in one or more packets, each independent of the other as far as the Internet Protocol program itself is concerned. (The upper layer Transmission Control Protocol - TCP - does relate packets to each other, but uses the information within the packet rather than some external information to do this.) The term connectionless is also used to describe communication in which a connection is made and terminated for each message that is sent. IP is connectionless as well as stateless.
The Web's Hypertext Transfer Protocol ( HTTP ), an application layer above TCP/IP, is also stateless. Each request from a user for a Web page or URL results in the requested pages being served, but without the Web (HTTP) server remembering the request later. In other words, there is no recorded continuity. Each communication is discrete and unrelated to those that precede or follow. In order to have stateful communication, a site developer must furnish a special program that the server can call that can record and retrieve state information. Web browsers such as Netscape Explorer and Microsoft Internet Explorer provide an area in their subdirectories where state information can be stored and accessed. The area and the information that Web browsers and server applications put in this area is called a cookie .
In formal protocol specifications, a finite state machine is an abstract desciption of how a stateful system works that describes the action that follows each possible state.
The Internet (including the World Wide Web) can be thought of as a stateless system or machine. Most computers, human beings, and elephants are stateful.

Query String
Query string nedir, stateless nedir
ÇOK ÖNEMLİ TEXT:
A query string is the portion of a URL where data is passed to a web application and/or back-end database. The reason we need query strings is that the HTTP protocol is stateless by design. For a website to be anything more than a brochure, you need to maintain state (store data). 
There are a number of ways to do this: On most web servers, you can use something like session state server-side. On the client, you can store via cookies. Or in the URL, you can store data via a query string. 

On the world wide web, all URLs can be broken down into the protocol, the location of the file (or program) and the query string. The protocol you see in a browser is almost always HTTP; the location is the typical form of the hostname and filename (for example, www.techopedia.com/somefile.html), and the query string is whatever follows the question mark sign ("?").
For example, in the URL below, the bolded area is the query string that was generated when the term "database" was searched on the Techopedia website.

IIS- Internet Information Services  (GITHUB)
IIS nedir, iis nedir
Stands for "Internet Information Services." IIS is a web server software package designed for Windows Server. It is used for hosting websites and other content on the Web.
Microsoft’s Internet Information Services provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing websites and the associated users. It provides a visual means of creating, configuring, and publishing sites on the web. The IIS Manager tool allows web administrators to modify website options, such as default pages, error pages, logging settings, security settings, and performance optimizations.
IIS can serve both standard HTML webpages and dynamic webpages, such as ASP.NET applications and PHP pages. When a visitor accesses a page on a static website, IIS simply sends the HTML and associated images to the user’s browser. When a page on a dynamic website is accessed, IIS runs any applications and processes any scripts contained in the page, then sends the resulting data to the user’s browser.
While IIS includes all the features necessary to host a website, it also supports extensions (or “modules”) that add extra functionality to the server. For example, the WinCache Extension enables PHP scripts to run faster by caching PHP processes. The URL Rewrite module allows webmasters to publish pages with friendly URLs that are easier for visitors to type and remember. A streaming extension can be installed to provide streaming media to website visitors.
IIS is a popular option for commercial websites, since it offers many advanced features and is supported by Microsoft. However, it also requires requires a commercial license and the pricing increases depending on the number of users. Therefore, Apache HTTP Server, which is open source and free for unlimited users, remains the most popular web server software.

Internet Information Service (IIS), Microsoft firmasının Windows işletim sistemlerinde ve sunucularında kullandığı, Web servisini sunan alt yazılımdır.

CakePHP 	(GITHUB)
CakePHP is an open-source web framework. It follows the model–view–controller (MVC) approach and is written in PHP, modeled after the concepts of Ruby on Rails, and distributed under the MIT License.

CakePHP uses well-known software engineering concepts and software design patterns, such as convention over configuration, model–view–controller, active record, association data mapping, and front controller.

CakePHP started in April 2005, when a Polish programmer Michal Tatarynowicz[3] wrote a minimal version of a rapid application development framework in PHP, dubbing it Cake.[4][5][6] He published the framework under the MIT license, and opened it up to the online community of developers. In December 2005, L. Masters and G. J. Woodworth founded the Cake Software Foundation to promote development related to CakePHP.[6] Version 1.0 was released in May 2006.

One of the project's inspirations was Ruby on Rails, using many of its concepts. The community has since grown and spawned several sub-projects.

Encapsulation
encapsulation nedir
Encapsulation is implemented by using access specifiers. An access specifier defines the scope and visibility of a class member. C# supports the following access specifiers −
•	Public
•	Private
•	Protected
•	Internal
•	Protected internal

Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. In a different way, encapsulation is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.
•	Technically in encapsulation, the variables or data of a class are hidden from any other class and can be accessed only through any member function of own class in which they are declared.
•	As in encapsulation, the data in a class is hidden from other classes, so it is also known as data-hiding.
•	Encapsulation can be achieved by: Declaring all the variables in the class as private and using C# Properties in the class to set and get the values of variables.
 

using System;
  
public class DemoEncap
{
    // private variables declared 
    // these can only be accessed by public methods of class 
    private String studentName;
    private int studentAge;
 
    // using accessors to get and set the value of studentName 
    public String Name
    {
        get
        {
            return studentName;
        }
 
        set
        {
            studentName = value;
        }
    }
 
    // using accessors to get and set the value of studentAge 
    public int Age
    {
        get
        {
            return studentAge;
        }
 
        set
        {
            studentAge = value;
        }
    }
}
 
// Driver Class 
class GFG
{
 
    // Main Method 
    static public void Main()
    {
 
        // creating object 
        DemoEncap obj = new DemoEncap();
 
        // calls set accessor of the property Name,  
        // and pass "Ankita" as value of the  
        // standard field 'value' 
        obj.Name = "Ankita";
 
        // calls set accessor of the property Age,  
        // and pass "21" as value of the  
        // standard field 'value' 
        obj.Age = 21;
 
        // Displaying values of the variables 
        Console.WriteLine("Name: " + obj.Name);
        Console.WriteLine("Age: " + obj.Age);
    }
}

 
Output:
Name: Ankita
Age: 21
Explanation: In the above program the class DemoEncap is encapsulated as the variables are declared as private. To access these private variables we are using the Name and Age accessors which contains the get and set method to retrieve and set the values of private fields. Accessors are defined as public so that they can access in other class.

Advantages of Encapsulation:
•	Data Hiding: The user will have no idea about the inner implementation of the class. It will not be visible to the user that how the class is stored values in the variables. He only knows that we are passing the values to accessors and variables are getting initialized to that value.
•	Increased Flexibility: We can make the variables of the class as read-only or write-only depending on our requirement. If we wish to make the variables as read-only then we have to only use Get Accessor in the code. If we wish to make the variables as write-only then we have to only use Set Accessor.
•	Reusability: Encapsulation also improves the re-usability and easy to change with new requirements.
•	Testing code is easy: Encapsulated code is easy to test for unit testing.

Result set nedir
An SQL result set is a set of rows from a database, as well as metadata about the query such as the column names, and the types and sizes of each column. Depending on the database system, the number of rows in the result set may or may not be known. Usually, this number is not known up front because the result set is built on-the-fly.

A result set is effectively a table. The ORDER BY clause can be used in a query to impose a certain sort condition on the rows. Without that clause, there is no guarantee whatsoever on the order in which the rows are returned.

Oracle ile MYSQL arasındaki farklar üzerine:
SQL is a database language used with Oracle Database.
MySQL is a database itself that uses SQL language.
The difference is that MySQL is free, and the world's most popular database, and Oracle isn't free (except with trials and certain products) and makes billions from selling premium database software to large enterprises and SME.

There are many more differences between Oracle and MySQL.We can summarise them as follows-
1.Oracle is way more powerful than MySQL
2.Oracle supports distributed databases while MySQL doesn’t
3.Oracle supports save points while MySQL doesn’t
4.Oracle allows programs within the database while MySQL doesn’t
5.Oracle is suited for enterprise deployments while MySQL is suited for small to medium scale
6.Oracle requires that you pay a licensing fee while MySQL doesn’t

-- Daha anlamlı bir açıklama:
This might be a slightly controversial view ( and this is all in my opinion).
   
I have been a Developer for most of my career and I have used an old hierarchical DB, called HP Image 3000, Oracle, MS SQL and MySQL.
IMO, there is a lot of snobbery around Oracle. Its very good, but very expensive and in my opinion largely unnecessary and over used.
When you consider how many large companies and applications use MySQL without any issue, it will cope with 90% of demand. Hardware is so powerful now and the original concerns about performance are largely negated by the raw power of the hardware. Oracle should be a niche market and not a large player, as it really isn’t needed.
I worked for a large American company who used Oracle, I asked why, they said because its the best, I persisted and said what do you mean, they had no answer.
MySQL will be fine for most things and as its free, why not use that. The advent of cloud computing and the pricing model of many data centers, makes licencing very expensive (virtual CPU’s cores) for both Oracle and MS SQL.
Facebook, Uber and Google, used/use MySQL, so the idea its not scalable, is a bit ridiculous.
What is sad and I really mean it, is that the traditional IT Operations and the DBA role in IT, will slowly disappear, as its not really needed unless in some extreme situations.
-- Diğer açıklama:

Oracle is a Database tool that uses PL/SQL language.
MySQL is a also a Database tool itself that uses SQL language.

What is PL/SQL?
Pl-sql nedir plsql nedir pl/sql nedir
PL/SQL is an extension of Structured Query Language (SQL) that is used in Oracle. Unlike SQL, PL/SQL allows the programmer to write code in a procedural format. Full form of PL/SQL is "Procedural Language extensions to SQL".
It combines the data manipulation power of SQL with the processing power of procedural language to create super powerful SQL queries.
PL/SQL means instructing the compiler 'what to do' through SQL and 'how to do' through its procedural way.
Similar to other database languages, it gives more control to the programmers by the use of loops, conditions and object-oriented concepts.

SQL 	 (GITHUB)    (read -ama tekrar)
SQL nedir
In 1970's the product called 'SEQUEL', structured English query language, developed by IBM and later SEQUEL was renamed to 'SQL' which stands for Structured Query Language.
In 1986, SQL was approved by ANSI (American national Standards Institute) and in 1987, it was approved by ISO (International Standards Organization).
SQL is a structure query language which is a common database language for all RDBMS products. Different RDBMS product vendors have developed their own database language by extending SQL for their own RDBMS products.
T-SQL stands for Transact Structure Query Language which is a Microsoft product and is an extension of SQL Language. Example:
MS SQL Server --> SQL\T-SQL
ORACLE        --> SQL\PL-SQL

NoSQL	(GITHUB)
Nosql nedir
https://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/06/top-nosql-database-engines.html
İlişkisiz veritabanıdır. NoSQL is not a relational database.
Bir NoSQL veritabanında, kayıtlar genellikle bir JSON belgesi olarak saklanır.
Why NoSQL? It's high performance with high availability, and offers rich query language and easy scalability.

NoSQL (ilişkisel olmayan) Veritabanları Nasıl Çalışır?
NoSQL veritabanları, verilere erişmek ve verileri yönetmek için belge, grafik, anahtar-değer, bellek içi ve arama dahil olmak üzere çeşitli veri modelleri kullanır. Bu tür veritabanları, özellikle büyük veri hacmi, düşük gecikme süresi ve esnek veri modelleri gerektiren uygulamalar için optimize edilmiştir. Bu gereksinimler, diğer veritabanlarının veri tutarlılığı kısıtlamalarının bir kısmı esnetilerek karşılanır.
NoSQL is a whole new way of thinking about a database. NoSQL is not a relational database. The reality is that a relational database model may not be the best solution for all situations. The easiest way to think of NoSQL, is that of a database which does not adhering to the traditional relational database management system (RDMS) structure. Sometimes you will also see it revered to as 'not only SQL'.

Imagine that you have coupons that you wanted to push to mobile customers that purchase a specific item. This is a customer facing system of engagement requires location data, purchase data, wallet data, and so on. You want to engage the mobile customer in real-time.

What you require is a very agile delivery system that is easily able to processes unstructured data. The system of engagement would need to be extremely dynamic. 

Basit bir kitap veritabanının şemasını modelleme örneğini ele alalım:
•	İlişkisel bir veritabanında genellikle bir kitap kaydı gizlenerek (veya “normalleştirilerek”) ayrı tablolarda depolanırken, ilişkiler birincil ve yabancı anahtar kısıtlamaları tarafından tanımlanır. Bu örnekte Books (Kitaplar) tablosu ISBN, Book Title (Kitap Başlığı) ve Edition Number (Baskı Sayısı) sütunlarına; Authors (Yazarlar) tablosu AuthorID (Yazar Kimliği) ve Author Name (Yazar Adı) sütunlarına; Author-ISBN (Yazar-ISBN) tablosu ise AuthorID (Yazar Kimliği) ve ISBN sütunlarına sahiptir. İlişkisel model, veritabanının yedekliliği azaltacak şekilde normalleştirilmiş ve genel olarak depolama için optimize edilmiş tablolar arasında başvurusal bütünlük uygulamasına imkan tanıyacak şekilde tasarlanmıştır.
•	Bir NoSQL veritabanında, kitap kaydı genellikle bir JSON belgesi olarak saklanır. Her kitap için öğe, ISBN, Book Title (Kitap Başlığı), Edition Number (Baskı Sayısı), Author Name (Yazar Adı) ve AuthorID (Yazar Kimliği) bilgileri tek bir belgede öznitelikler olarak depolanır. Bu modelde, veriler sezgisel yazılım geliştirme ve yatay ölçeklenebilirlik için optimize edilir.

Neden NoSQL veritabanı kullanmalısınız?
NoSQL veritabanları, harika kullanıcı deneyimleri sunulması amacıyla esnek, ölçeklenebilir, yüksek performanslı ve yüksek oranda işlevsel veritabanları gerektiren mobil, web ve oyun gibi birçok modern uygulama için idealdir.
•	Esneklik: NoSQL genellikle daha hızlı ve daha fazla yinelemeli yazılım geliştirmeyi mümkün kılan esnek şemalar sağlar. Esnek veri modeli sayesinde NoSQL veritabanları yarı yapılandırılmış ve yapılandırılmamış veriler için idealdir.
•	Ölçeklenebilirlik: NoSQL veritabanları genellikle pahalı ve kalıcı sunucular eklenerek ölçeği artırılabilecek şekilde değil, dağıtılmış donanım kümeleri kullanılarak ölçeği genişletilebilecek şekilde tasarlanır. Bazı bulut sağlayıcıları bu işlemleri arka planda, tam olarak yönetilen bir hizmet olarak gerçekleştirir.
•	Yüksek performans: NoSQL veritabanları, benzer işlevlerin ilişkisel veritabanlarıyla gerçekleştirilmesi ile karşılaştırıldığında daha yüksek performansı mümkün kılan belirli veri modelleri (belge, anahtar-değer, grafik gibi) ve erişim desenleri için optimize edilmiştir.
•	Yüksek oranda işlevsel: NoSQL veritabanları, her biri ilgili veri modeli için özel olarak tasarlanmış yüksek oranda işlevsel API'ler ve veri türleri sağlar.

Redis (Remote Dictionary Server)	   (GITHUB)
Redis nedir
Redis, bir milisaniyenin altında yanıt süreleri sunan, açık kaynak kodlu bir bellek içi veri deposudur. 
Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes with radius queries and streams. Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.

Redis (/ˈrɛdɪs/; Remote Dictionary Server) is an in-memory data structure project implementing a distributed, in-memory key-value database with optional durability. Redis supports different kinds of abstract data structures, such as strings, lists, maps, sets, sorted sets, HyperLogLogs, bitmaps, streams, and spatial indexes. The project is mainly developed by Salvatore Sanfilippo and as of 2019, is sponsored by Redis Labs.[8] It is open-source software released under a BSD 3-clause license.

History
The name Redis means REmote DIctionary Server.[6] The Redis project began when Salvatore Sanfilippo, nicknamed antirez, the original developer of Redis, was trying to improve the scalability of his Italian startup, developing a real-time web log analyzer. After encountering significant problems in scaling some types of workloads using traditional database systems, Sanfilippo began to prototype a first proof of concept version of Redis in Tcl.[9] Later Sanfilippo translated that prototype to the C language and implemented the first data type, the list. After a few weeks of using the project internally with success, Sanfilippo decided to open source it, announcing the project on Hacker News. The project began to get traction, more so among the Ruby community, with GitHub and Instagram being among the first companies adopting it.

Difference between scaling horizontally and vertically for databases		(GITHUB)

Horizontal scaling nedir, vertical scaling nedir

Horizontal scaling means that you scale by adding more machines into your pool of resources whereas Vertical scaling means that you scale by adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine.
An easy way to remember this is to think of a machine on a server rack, we add more machines across the horizontal direction and add more resources to a machine in the vertical direction.
                   
In a database world horizontal-scaling is often based on the partitioning of the data i.e. each node contains only part of the data, in vertical-scaling the data resides on a single node and scaling is done through multi-core i.e. spreading the load between the CPU and RAM resources of that machine.
With horizontal-scaling it is often easier to scale dynamically by adding more machines into the existing pool - Vertical-scaling is often limited to the capacity of a single machine, scaling beyond that capacity often involves downtime and comes with an upper limit.
Good examples of horizontal scaling are Cassandra, MongoDB, Google Cloud Spanner .. and a good example of vertical scaling is MySQL - Amazon RDS (The cloud version of MySQL). It provides an easy way to scale vertically by switching from small to bigger machines. This process often involves downtime.
In-Memory Data Grids such as GigaSpaces XAP, Coherence etc.. are often optimized for both horizontal and vertical scaling simply because they're not bound to disk. Horizontal-scaling through partitioning and vertical-scaling through multi-core support.

Distributed database / DDBMS
Distributed database nedir? DDBMS nedir (distributed database management system)
A distributed database is a database that consists of two or more files located in different sites either on the same network or on entirely different networks. Portions of the database are stored in multiple physical locations and processing is distributed among multiple database nodes.
Önemli notlar: 
Distributed databases are capable of modular development, meaning that systems can be expanded by adding new computers and local data to the new site and connecting them to the distributed system without interruption.
When failures occur in centralized databases, the system comes to a complete stop. When a component fails in distributed database systems, however, the system will continue to function at reduced performance until the error is fixed.
Admins can achieve lower communication costs for distributed database systems if the data is located close to where it is used the most. This is not possible in centralized systems.
-not bitiş
Kısa açıklama:
A distributed database is a database in which not all storage devices are attached to a common processor.[1] It may be stored in multiple computers, located in the same physical location; or may be dispersed over a network of interconnected computers. Unlike parallel systems, in which the processors are tightly coupled and constitute a single database system, a distributed database system consists of loosely coupled sites that share no physical components.

A centralized distributed database management system (DDBMS) integrates data logically so it can be managed as if it were all stored in the same location. The DDBMS synchronizes all the data periodically and ensures that data updates and deletes performed at one location will be automatically reflected in the data stored elsewhere.
By contrast, a centralized database consists of a single database file located at one site using a single network.
When in a collection, distributed databases are logically interrelated with each other, and they often represent a single logical database. With distributed databases, data is physically stored across multiple sites and independently managed. The processors on each site are connected by a network, and they don't have any multiprocessing configuration.
A common misconception is that a distributed database is a loosely connected file system. In reality, it's much more complicated than that. Distributed databases incorporate transaction processing, but are not synonymous with transaction processing systems.
In general, distributed databases include the following features:
•	Location independent
•	Distributed query processing
•	Distributed transaction management
•	Hardware independent
•	Operating system independent
•	Network independent
•	Transaction transparency
•	DBMS independent
Distributed database architecture
(homogenous distributed database system nedir, heterogeneous distributed database nedir)
Distributed databases can be homogenous or heterogeneous.
In a homogenous distributed database system, all the physical locations have the same underlying hardware and run the same operating systems and database applications. Homogenous distributed database systems appear to the user as a single system, and they can be much easier to design and manage. For a distributed database system to be homogenous, the data structures at each location must be either identical or compatible. The database application used at each location must also be either identical or compatible.

Features of a distributed database
In a heterogeneous distributed database, the hardware, operating systems or database applications may be different at each location. Different sites may use different schemas and software, although a difference in schema can make query and transaction processing difficult.
Different nodes may have different hardware, software and data structure, or they may be in locations that are not compatible. Users at one location may be able to read data at another location but not upload or alter it. Heterogeneous distributed databases are often difficult to use, making them economically infeasible for many businesses.
Types of distributed databases
Replicated data is used to create instances of data in different parts of the database. By using replicated data, distributed databases can access identical data locally, thus avoiding traffic. Replicated data can be divided into two categories: read-only and writable data.
Read-only versions of replicated data allow revisions only to the first instance; subsequent enterprise data replications are then adjusted. Writable data can be altered, but the first instance is immediately changed.
Horizontally fragmented data involves the use of primary keys that refer to one record in the database. Horizontal fragmentation is usually reserved for situations in which business locations only need to access the database pertaining to their specific branch.
Vertically fragmented data involves using copies of primary keys that are available within each section of the database and are accessible to each branch. Vertically fragmented data is utilized when the branch of a business and the central location interact with the same accounts in different ways.

F10 vs F11	(GITHUB)
Yeni başlayanlar için güzel bir not
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15584132/what-is-the-difference-between-f10-and-f11-keys-in-visual-studio/39843982
F10 ("step over") does not descend any further into the call stack. It moves to the next line of the current function.
F11 ("step into") drills down into the function being called.
void function1()
{
    function2();
    function3();
}
If you hit a breakpoint on function2(), F10 will advance to the line function3(). F11 will advance to the first line inside function2.

Database Management System / DBMS	(GITHUB)  (test)
Dbms nedir

DBMS: The software which is used to manage database is called Database Management System (DBMS). For Example, MySQL, Oracle etc. are popular commercial DBMS used in different applications. DBMS allows users the following tasks:
Data Definition: It helps in creation, modification and removal of definitions that define the organization of data in database.
Data Updation: It helps in insertion, modification and deletion of the actual data in the database.
Data Retrieval: It helps in retrieval of data from the database which can be used by applications for various purposes.
User Administration: It helps in registering and monitoring users, enforcing data security, monitoring performance, maintaining data integrity, dealing with concurrency control and recovering information corrupted by unexpected failure.
Introduction of DBMS (Database Management System) | Set 1
Important Terminology
Database: Database is a collection of inter-related data which helps in efficient retrieval, insertion and deletion of data from database and organizes the data in the form of tables, views, schemas, reports etc. For Example, university database organizes the data about students, faculty, and admin staff etc. which helps in efficient retrieval, insertion and deletion of data from it.
(DDL nedir)
DDL is short name of Data Definition Language, which deals with database schemas and descriptions, of how the data should reside in the database.
CREATE: to create a database and its objects like (table, index, views, store procedure, function, and triggers)
ALTER: alters the structure of the existing database
DROP: delete objects from the database
(truncate nedir)
TRUNCATE: remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed
COMMENT: add comments to the data dictionary
RENAME: rename an object
(dml nedir)
DML is short name of Data Manipulation Language which deals with data manipulation and includes most common SQL statements such SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc., and it is used to store, modify, retrieve, delete and update data in a database.
SELECT: retrieve data from a database
INSERT: insert data into a table
UPDATE: updates existing data within a table
DELETE: Delete all records from a database table
MERGE: UPSERT operation (insert or update)
CALL: call a PL/SQL or Java subprogram
EXPLAIN PLAN: interpretation of the data access path
LOCK TABLE: concurrency Control
Database Management System: The software which is used to manage database is called Database Management System (DBMS). For Example, MySQL, Oracle etc. are popular commercial DBMS used in different applications. DBMS allows users the following tasks:
Data Definition: It helps in creation, modification and removal of definitions that define the organization of data in database.
Data Updation: It helps in insertion, modification and deletion of the actual data in the database.
Data Retrieval: It helps in retrieval of data from the database which can be used by applications for various purposes.
User Administration: It helps in registering and monitoring users, enforcing data security, monitoring performance, maintaining data integrity, dealing with concurrency control and recovering information corrupted by unexpected failure.
Paradigm Shift from File System to DBMS
 File System manages data using files in hard disk. Users are allowed to create, delete, and update the files according to their requirement. Let us consider the example of file based University Management System. Data of students is available to their respective Departments, Academics Section, Result Section, Accounts Section, Hostel Office etc. Some of the data is common for all sections like Roll No, Name, Father Name, Address and Phone number of students but some data is available to a particular section only like Hostel allotment number which is a part of hostel office. Let us discuss the issues with this system:
Redundancy of data: Data is said to be redundant if same data is copied at many places. If a student wants to change Phone number, he has to get it updated at various sections. Similarly, old records must be deleted from all sections representing that student.
Inconsistency of Data: Data is said to be inconsistent if multiple copies of same data does not match with each other. If Phone number is different in Accounts Section and Academics Section, it will be inconsistent. Inconsistency may be because of typing errors or not updating all copies of same data.
Difficult Data Access: A user should know the exact location of file to access data, so the process is very cumbersome and tedious. If user wants to search student hostel allotment number of a student from 10000 unsorted students’ records, how difficult it can be.
Unauthorized Access: File System may lead to unauthorized access to data. If a student gets access to file having his marks, he can change it in unauthorized way.
No Concurrent Access: The access of same data by multiple users at same time is known as concurrency. File system does not allow concurrency as data can be accessed by only one user at a time.
No Backup and Recovery: File system does not incorporate any backup and recovery of data if a file is lost or corrupted.
These are the main reasons which made a shift from file system to DBMS.

Access Modifier = Access Specifier = Erişim Modifiyeri)                               	 (GITHUB)
Access modifier nedir, public nedir, private nedir, protected nedir, internal nedir, access specifier nedir, access modifier nedir
Access specifier de denir, access modifier de denir. Kaynaklar incelendi: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/What-are-the-different-access-specifiers-in-Chash-NET
All types and type members have an accessibility level, which controls whether they can be used from other code in your assembly or other assemblies. You can use the following access modifiers to specify the accessibility of a type or member when you declare it:
public

The type or member can be accessed by any other code in the same assembly or another assembly that references it.
private

The type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class or struct.
protected

The type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class, or in a class that is derived from that class. (class dışından erişemezsin)

internal

The type or member can be accessed by any code in the same assembly, but not from another assembly.
protected internal 

The type or member can be accessed by any code in the assembly in which it is declared, or from within a derived class in another assembly.
private protected 

The type or member can be accessed only within its declaring assembly, by code in the same class or in a type that is derived from that class.
The following examples demonstrate how to specify access modifiers on a type and member:
public class Bicycle
{
    public void Pedal() { }
}
Not all access modifiers can be used by all types or members in all contexts, and in some cases the accessibility of a type member is constrained by the accessibility of its containing type. The following sections provide more details about accessibility.
Class and Struct Accessibility
Classes and structs that are declared directly within a namespace (in other words, that are not nested within other classes or structs) can be either public or internal. Internal is the default if no access modifier is specified.
Struct members, including nested classes and structs, can be declared as public, internal, or private. Class members, including nested classes and structs, can be public, protected internal, protected, internal, private protected or private. The access level for class members and struct members, including nested classes and structs, is private by default. Private nested types are not accessible from outside the containing type.
Derived classes cannot have greater accessibility than their base types. In other words, you cannot have a public class B that derives from an internal class A. If this were allowed, it would have the effect of making A public, because all protected or internal members of A are accessible from the derived class.
You can enable specific other assemblies to access your internal types by using the InternalsVisibleToAttribute. For more information, see Friend Assemblies.

Nested Classes
Nested class nedir, nested classes nedir
When one class is entirely dependent upon another, you may decide to implement it using a nested class. Nested classes are declared within the scope of an existing class and receive special benefits when they access their parent class's members.


What are Nested Classes?
A nested class is a special type of class that can be created using C#. Normally classes are declared within a namespace, or in the default namespace if one is not specified. A nested class is defined within the code block of another class, which itself may be a nested class to permit multiple nesting levels.


A nested class generally behaves is the same way as any other class. It can be instantiated separately to its parent class and is not instantiated automatically by its parent. However, there are some important differences. One key difference concerns the scope of the class. Normally classes can be either public or internal. A nested class may be declared as private, meaning that the class can only be seen by its parent class and other nested classes within that parent. A nested class may also be declared as protected, allowing it to also be accessed by classes that derive from its parent type. This may be extended to protected internal to allow other classes in the same assembly to access it.

Nested classes are given special access to instances of their parent classes. When an object of a parent class is passed to a method of a nested class, the method is permitted to access the private and protected members of the object. This makes nested classes ideal where a special relationship exists with the parent class that requires access to private members, particularly when the nested class is not required anywhere else and is never used in a standalone capability.

Example Nested Classes
We will start with a simple example of a nested class. In this case, the outer class will describe a sales order in an order-processing system. In this rather contrived design, there is no requirement for an order line to ever be created without an order. Furthermore, there is no need for an order line to be used externally to an order. In this case, it is useful to create an Order class with a nested, private OrderLine class.
NB: The following code uses .NET 3.0 syntax for brevity. For earlier versions of the .NET framework, you will need to expand the property declarations and possibly remove the use of generics.


class Order
{
    private List<OrderLine> _orderLines = new List<OrderLine>();
 
    public void AddOrderLine(string product, int quantity, double price)
    {
        OrderLine line = new OrderLine();
        line.ProductName = product;
        line.Quantity = quantity;
        line.Price = price;
        _orderLines.Add(line);
    }
 
    public double OrderTotal()
    {
        double total = 0;
        foreach (OrderLine line in _orderLines)
        {
            total += line.OrderLineTotal();
        }
        return total;
    }
 
    // Nested class
    private class OrderLine
    {
        public string ProductName { get; set; }
        public int Quantity { get; set; }
        public double Price { get; set; }
 
        public double OrderLineTotal()
        {
            return Price * Quantity;
        }
    }
}
The code above shows the simplified Order and nested OrderLine classes. The Order class has two public members. The first allows an item to be added to a private collection of order lines. The product name, price and quantity are passed to this method, which builds an OrderLine object and adds it to the list. The second method loops through each item in the collection and calculates the total value for the order.
The nested OrderLine class is used to represent order lines. It includes properties for the product name, quantity and price and a single method that calculates the total price for the order line. As the class is marked as private, it is invisible to all classes except its parent and any other nested classes that we may later create within Order. We could change the access modifier for the nested class to protected if we wished it to be visible to classes that inherit from Order.
We can test the order mechanism with the following code. This creates an order with two order lines and outputs the total value to the console:
Order order = new Order();
order.AddOrderLine("Cheese", 5, 1.99);
order.AddOrderLine("Oranges", 12, 0.35);
Console.WriteLine(order.OrderTotal());  // Outputs "14.15"
Increasing Nested Class Visibility
As our ordering system evolves, we may decide that it would be useful to permit other classes access to the nested OrderLine class. We could then modify the AddOrderLine method to accept an OrderLine object rather than its constituent parts. We can do this by changing the access modifier of the nested class to internal, protected internal or public, depending upon the requirements. The following code shows a new version of the code:

class Order
{
    private List<OrderLine> _orderLines = new List<OrderLine>();
 
    public void AddOrderLine(OrderLine line)
    {
        _orderLines.Add(line);
    }
 
    public double OrderTotal()
    {
        double total = 0;
        foreach (OrderLine line in _orderLines)
        {
            total += line.OrderLineTotal();
        }
        return total;
    }
 
    // Nested class
    internal class OrderLine
    {
        public string ProductName { get; set; }
        public int Quantity { get; set; }
        public double Price { get; set; }
 
        public double OrderLineTotal()
        {
            return Price * Quantity;
        }
    }
}


With the new versions of the classes, the code that creates an order will also be different. Rather than passing the product details as separate variables, the calling class will instantiate order lines and pass these to the AddOrderLine method. When instantiating a nested class, the name of the class must be qualified by prefixing it with the parent class's name, as in the following, updated example. Note that the order lines are created as Order.OrderLine objects.

Order order = new Order();
 
Order.OrderLine line1 = new Order.OrderLine(); //vaaay olaya gel

line1.ProductName = "Cheese";
line1.Quantity = 5;
line1.Price = 1.99;
order.AddOrderLine(line1);
 
Order.OrderLine line2 = new Order.OrderLine();
line2.ProductName = "Oranges";
line2.Quantity = 12;
line2.Price = 0.35;
order.AddOrderLine(line2);
 
Console.WriteLine(order.OrderTotal());


Accessing Private Members of the Parent Class
The final example will demonstrate the ability for nested classes to access private members of their parent classes. In this example, we have modified the order to include a discount multiplier. The multiplier is held as a private variable that may have been initialised using a constructor or a property. In this case the value is fixed at 0.85. Every order line value will be multiplied by this amount to give a 15% discount.
To allow the order lines to access the discount multiplier, the OrderLineTotal method has been updated to include a parameter. This parameter accepts an Order object. The method retrieves the private discount multiplier from the Order and includes it in the calculation, rounding the result to two decimal places on a line-by-line basis. If the OrderLine class was not nested within Order, this would not be possible.

class Order
{
    private List<OrderLine> _orderLines = new List<OrderLine>();
    private double DiscountMultiplier = 0.85;
 
    public void AddOrderLine(OrderLine line)
    {
        _orderLines.Add(line);
    }
 
    public double OrderTotal()
    {
        double total = 0;
        foreach (OrderLine line in _orderLines)
        {
            total += line.OrderLineTotal(this);
        }
        return total;
    }
 
    // Nested class
    internal class OrderLine
    {
        public string ProductName { get; set; }
        public int Quantity { get; set; }
        public double Price { get; set; }
 
        public double OrderLineTotal(Order order)
        {
            return Math.Round(Price * Quantity * order.DiscountMultiplier, 2);
        }
    }
}

NB: Although nested classes can access the private members of their parent class, the reverse is not true. Private members of nested classes are invisible to their parent class.

SQL
SQL nedir
In 1970's the product called 'SEQUEL', structured English query language, developed by IBM and later SEQUEL was renamed to 'SQL' which stands for Structured Query Language.
In 1986, SQL was approved by ANSI (American national Standards Institute) and in 1987, it was approved by ISO (International Standards Organization).
SQL is a structure query language which is a common database language for all RDBMS products. Different RDBMS product vendors have developed their own database language by extending SQL for their own RDBMS products.
T-SQL stands for Transact Structure Query Language which is a Microsoft product and is an extension of SQL Language. Example:
MS SQL Server --> SQL\T-SQL
ORACLE        --> SQL\PL-SQL

derive, derivation, inherit, inheritance kelimeleri
Derive nedir, derivation nedir, inherit nedir, inheritance nedir, derive from nedir, inherit from nedir
Kelimelerin nasıl kullanılabileceğiyle ilgili bilgi içerir:
	Derive
A class can be derived from more than one class or interface 
(derive meaning: obtain something from (a specified source)).

Definition - What does Derived Class mean?
A derived class is a class created or derived from another existing class. The existing class from which the derived class is created through the process of inheritance is known as a base class or superclass.

class <derived_class> : <base_class> 
{
}
	Inherit
Definition - What does Inherited Class mean?
An inherited class is called a subclass of its parent class or super class.
class B inherits from class A: 
class B : A {}
(inherit meaning: derive (a quality, characteristic, or predisposition) genetically from one's parents or ancestors.)
Örnek cümle: The child classes inherit methods and properties of the parent class

sealed 
Sealed nedir
Sealed bir access modifier değildir! Evet, bir modifier'dir. Ama access modifier değildir. Çünkü access'i yani erişimi değiştirmez, yani erişimi modifiye etmez.
Peki sealed tanımda ne olarak geçer?
Sealed bir modifier'dir.
Sealed daha genel anlamda bakıldığında bir keyword'dür tabi ki: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/
Sealed'in neden bir access modifier olmadığına dair güzel bir cevap: Cause if you cannot derive from a class it doesn't mean you cannot access it.
When applied to a class, the sealed modifier prevents other classes from inheriting from it. In the following example, class B inherits from class A, but no class can inherit from class B.
class A {}
sealed class B : A {}
Önemli: You can also use the sealed modifier on a method or property that overrides a virtual method or property in a base class. This enables you to allow classes to derive from your class and prevent them from overriding specific virtual methods or properties.
Example (gayet açık)
In the following example, Z inherits from Y but Z cannot override the virtual function F that is declared in X and sealed in Y.
C#Copy
class X
{
    protected virtual void F() { Console.WriteLine("X.F"); }
    protected virtual void F2() { Console.WriteLine("X.F2"); }
}

class Y : X
{
    sealed protected override void F() { Console.WriteLine("Y.F"); }
    protected override void F2() { Console.WriteLine("Y.F2"); }
}

class Z : Y
{
    // Attempting to override F causes compiler error CS0239.
    // protected override void F() { Console.WriteLine("Z.F"); }

    // Overriding F2 is allowed.
    protected override void F2() { Console.WriteLine("Z.F2"); }
}
When you define new methods or properties in a class, you can prevent deriving classes from overriding them by not declaring them as virtual.
It is an error to use the abstract modifier with a sealed class, because an abstract class must be inherited by a class that provides an implementation of the abstract methods or properties.
When applied to a method or property, the sealed modifier must always be used with override.
Because structs are implicitly sealed, they cannot be inherited.
For more information, see Inheritance.
For more examples, see Abstract and Sealed Classes and Class Members.
Example
sealed class SealedClass
{
    public int x;
    public int y;
}

class SealedTest2
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var sc = new SealedClass();
        sc.x = 110;
        sc.y = 150;
        Console.WriteLine($"x = {sc.x}, y = {sc.y}");
    }
}
// Output: x = 110, y = 150
In the previous example, you might try to inherit from the sealed class by using the following statement:
class MyDerivedC: SealedClass{} // Error
The result is an error message:
'MyDerivedC': cannot derive from sealed type 'SealedClass'
Remarks
To determine whether to seal a class, method, or property, you should generally consider the following two points:
•	The potential benefits that deriving classes might gain through the ability to customize your class.
•	The potential that deriving classes could modify your classes in such a way that they would no longer work correctly or as expected.

Dataset
DataSet: This is a collection of DataTables. We use the DataSet type to store many DataTables in a single collection. Conceptually, the DataSet acts as a set of DataTable instances. 
Usage: DataSet simplifies programs that use many DataTables. To effectively use the DataSet, you will need to have some DataTables handy. We begin by creating some. 
Create: In this program, we create two DataTables. One stores two rows of patient information. And the second stores two rows of medication information. 
Next: We create a DataSet with the DataSet constructor. Then we add the two DataTables to the DataSet instance. Finally we print the XML. 
DataSetName: Every DataSet can have a name specified. Usually, it is easiest to specify this inside the DataSet constructor. But you don't always know the name at this time. 
However: You can also change the name by assigning to the DataSetName property. You can also read the DataSetName property. 
Copy, Clear: DataSet has a Clear method that clears all the DataTables in the set. It also provides a Copy method that will make a deep copy of all the DataTables in the set. 
Tip: If you call Copy and the Clear the original, your copied data will still exist unchanged.
	public ActionResult Index()
	{
            // Önce DataSet oluşturuldu
            // Sonra DataTable oluşturuldu (tablo)
            // Sonra oluşturulan tabloya kolonlar eklendi
            // Sonra bu kolonlara örnek veriler eklendi (datarow)
            // Sonra ilk başta oluşturduğumuz Dataset'in içine, DataTable'ımızı yerleştirdik ve View'a yolladık.
 
            DataSet ds = new DataSet();
            DataTable dt = new DataTable("YeniTablo");
 
            dt.Clear();
 
            dt.Columns.Add("Isim");
            dt.Columns.Add("SoyIsim");
 
            DataRow dr = dt.NewRow();
 
            // Row'lar farklı şekilde de eklenebilir. 2. örneğe bakılabilir.
            dr["Isim"] = "Eren";
            dr["SoyIsim"] = "OZTEN";
            dt.Rows.Add(dr);
 
            ds.Tables.Add(dt);
 
            return View(ds);

View:

 
@model System.Data.DataSet

{
    @(row["Isim"] + " " + row["SoyIsim"])

            dataTable1.Rows.Add("Monte Cristo", 1);
            dataTable1.Rows.Add("Jane Eyre", 2);
 
            DataTable dataTable2 = new DataTable("Medications");
            dataTable2.Columns.Add("Id");
            dataTable2.Columns.Add("Medication");
            dataTable2.Rows.Add(1, "Atenolol");
            dataTable2.Rows.Add(2, "Amoxicillin");
 
            // Oluşturduğumuz dataTable'ları dataSet içine koyalım.
 
            DataSet dataSet = new DataSet("dataSetNam");
            dataSet.Tables.Add(dataTable1);
            dataSet.Tables.Add(dataTable2);

metadata
metadata nedir
Metadata is simply data about data. It means it is a description and context of the data. It helps to organize, find and understand data. Here are a few real world examples of metadata:
Those are some typical metadata elements:
1.	Title and description,
2.	Tags and categories,
3.	Who created and when,
4.	Who last modified and when,
5.	Who can access or update.
Every time you take a photo with today's cameras a bunch of metadata is gathered and saved with it:
•	date and time,
•	filename,
•	camera settings,
•	geolocation.

HTTPGet vs HTTPPost
Httpget nedir httppost nedir
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Un2JTC7tFPI
Videoyu izle…
Get yapınca veriler url ye yazılır. Post ta ise form yollanır… Url ile yollanmaz veri. Message body içinde yollanır.
Get metotlara url'ye yazıp enter yaparak ulaşılır. O yüzden tehlikeli olabilir…
DB'deki değerleri hem Get hem Post ile değiştirebiliriz tabi ki. Ama dediğimiz gibi get ile bunu yapmak tehlikelidir.
-
The GET Method
GET is used to request data from a specified resource. 
GET is one of the most common HTTP methods. 
Note that the query string (name/value pairs) is sent in the URL of a GET request: 
/test/demo_form.php?name1=value1&name2=value2
Some other notes on GET requests: 
GET requests can be cached
GET requests remain in the browser history
GET requests can be bookmarked
GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data
GET requests have length restrictions
GET requests are only used to request data (not modify)
The POST Method
POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource. 
The data sent to the server with POST is stored in the request body of the HTTP request: 
POST /test/demo_form.php HTTP/1.1
Host: w3schools.com
name1=value1&name2=value2
(yukarıda request body'nin neye benzediğini görmüş olduk. Get request'lerde request body yoktur. Veri url'den gönderilir)
Some other notes on POST requests:
POST requests are never cached
POST requests do not remain in the browser history
POST requests cannot be bookmarked
POST requests have no restrictions on data length
-
GET methodu HTTP istekleri arasındaki varsayılan yöntemdir.  GET metodu ile yapılan istekler tarayıcının adres satırında görünür. Sadece belirli boyutta veri gönderileceği zaman kullanılır.
POST metodu ise URL’ de görünmesini istemediğimiz veriler olduğunda kullanılabilir. POST yönteminde gönderebileceğimiz verinin boyutu ile ilgili bir sınır yoktur. Ayrıca gönderdiğimiz parametrelerin adres satırında görünmemesi dolayısıyla GET yöntemine göre daha güvenlidir. HTML form gönderileceği zaman neredeyse her zaman POST yöntemi tercih edilir.
Örnek vermek gerekirse Kisilers tablomuzun olduğu bir proje üzerinde kişi bilgilerini düzenlemek isteyebiliriz. Bunun için genellikle iki Action oluştururuz. Bunlardan biri kişinin ID sini parametre olarak alan gelen ID ye göre kişinin bilgilerini Edit formunda açan Action iken diğeri POST olduğunda yani Kaydet butonuna tıklandığında kullanılacak Actiondur.
 
public ActionResult Edit(int? id)
{
if (id == null)
 
{  return new HttpStatusCodeResult(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest);  }
 
Kisiler kisiler = db.Kisilers.Find(id);
 
if (kisiler == null) 
{
return HttpNotFound();
}
 
return View(kisiler);
}
 
Yukarıda ki Action’ da querystring’imiz kisa iken aşağıdakinde Kisilers tablosundaki kolon sayısına göre uzunluğu değişecek bir querystring söz konusu. Ayrıca buradan dönen bilgilerinde adres çubuğunda görünmesini istemediğimiz için POST methodunu kullanırız.
Önemli:
Browsers can cache GET requests, generally on static data, like images or scripts. But you can also allow browsers to cache GET requests to controller actions as well, using [OutputCache] or other similar ways, so if caching is turned on for a GET controller action, it's possible that clicking on a link leading to /Home/Index doesn't actually run the Index method on the server, but rather allows the browser to serve up the page from its own cache.
With this line of thinking, you can safely turn on caching on GET actions in which the data you're serving up doesn't change (or doesn't change often), with the knowledge that your server action won't fire every time.
POSTs won't be cached by the browser, so any POST is guaranteed to make it to the server.
-
Güzel bir açıklama:
Ignore caching for a moment. Another way of thinking about this is that search engines will store HTTP GET links during their indexing/crawling process, therefore they will show up in search results.
Suppose if your /Home/Index is implemented as GET but it lets say deletes a row in your Database, every time this link shows up on a search engine and somebody clicks it, you will have a delete row, and soon you have a lot deleted rows.

Bundling in MVC / Bundle in MVC 
Bundling  nedir, bundle nedir
Detaylı bilgil için link kesinlikle incelenmeli: https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/mvc/bundling-and-minification-in-asp.net-mvc
Bundle ingilizcede "demet" demektir... Bundling request'lerin daha hızlı gerçekleşmesi için yapılır. (Request load time'ı azaltmak için yapılır). İstenen statik dosyaları farklı farklı http request'lerle yollamaktansa hepsini bir bundle içinde (demette) toplayıp tek bir http request'iyle yollayabiliriz. Dolayısıyla bundling zaman yönünden verimlilik sağlayan bir tekniktir. Aklımıza şunu getirebiliriz: Çiçekleri tek tek vermektense bir demet halinde tek bir hamleyle veriyoruz. Bundling'in faydası sadece bununla sınırlı değildir.
Bundling, script/style dosyalarımızın gereksiz kısımlarını (gereksiz boşluklar vb) siler. Böylelikle dosyayı minimize etmiş olur (yani boyutunu düşürmüş olur). Bu da sunucu üzerine bindirilen yükü azaltır. Örneğin aşağıdaki kod parçacığını;
sayHello = function(name){
    //this is comment
    var msg = "Hello" + name;
    alert(msg);
}

Şu hale getirir:
sayHello=function(n){var t="Hello"+n;alert(t)}

Görüldüğü gibi comment satırını bile silmiş..
Not: Bahsedilen statik dosyalar hem script dosyaları, hem de style dosyaları olabilir. Script dosyalarımızı ScriptBundle kullanarak, style dosyalarımızı da StyleBundle kullanılarak gönderiyoruz.
Bundle'ları nasıl oluşturduğumuz ve View'da nasıl render ettiğimiz yukarıdaki linkte anlatılıyor. 

Script bundle:
https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/mvc/scriptbundle-mvc
bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle("~/bundles/myScriptsBundle").Include(
                "~/Scripts/myScript.js"));
buradaki  ScriptBundle'yi unutma. Bundle ye script koyacaksak; bunun adı ScriptBundle olmalı, yok eğer style dosyaları koyacaksak (CSS) o zaman adı StyleBundle olur.
~/bundles
bu kısmı yazmazsak çalışmıyor.
myScriptsBundle
bizim vereceğimiz özel isim, kafaya göre.
Scripts
bu ise script'in hangi file içinde olduğunu gösteriyor
myScript.js
çalıştırmak istediğimiz script dosyası..
sonra bu bundle'ı RENDER etmemiz gerekiyor. Yoksa çalışmaz. 
Scriptleri layoutta render edelim ki her sayfada geçerli olsun:
    @Scripts.Render("~/bundles/myScriptsBundle")

Not: render ederken diğer jquery vb dosyalarından sonra render et çünkü script'inde kesin jquery falan kullanmışsındır. o yüzden önce JQuery bundle render edilsin, sonra senin scriptin.

Style bundle:
STYLE'LAR BÖYLE YAPILMALI:
     bundles.Add(new StyleBundle("~/bundles/VereceginİsimKafayaGöre").Include(
                "~/Content/site2.css"));
    @Styles.Render("~/bundles/ VereceginİsimKafayaGöre")

Library	   (GITHUB) 		(read)
Library nedir
(Dapper,  Automapper vb birer library'dir, client side validation için kullandığımız  jQuery Unobtrusive Validation Library de bir library'dir)
Yazılım kütüphanesi (Software Library), yazılım geliştiricilerinin program geliştirirken kullandıkları bir tür program kodları ve veriler takımıdır. Yazılım kütüphaneleri, yazılımcılar ve programlama dilinin derleyicilerine çalıştırılabilir programlar geliştirme konusunda yardımcı olurlar. Yazılım kütüphaneleri içinde genellikle önceden hazırlanmış kodlar, sınıflar, prosedürler, betikler, konfigürasyon verilerini içerir.
Bir geliştirici yazılım geliştirirken yazılımını daha işlevsel hale getirmek veya çeşitli fonksiyonlar kazandırmak için yazılım kütüphanelerinden faydalanır. Yazılım kütüphaneleri yazılımcıların iş yükünü hafifletir ve aynı kodu tekrar yazmalarına gerek kalmadan onlara hazır bir kalıp sunar. Basit bir örnekle açıklamamız gerekirse; bir geliştirici matematikle ilgili bir yazılım geliştirdiğinde bu yazılıma karmaşık matematik işlemlerini yaptırması için ayrı ayrı modüller yazmak zorunda kalacaktır. Bu kodları yazmaya uğraşmak yerine yazılım kütüphanesindeki bir matematik modülünü alıp bu modülü doğrudan kendi yazılımına ilave edebilir.
In computer science, a library is a collection of non-volatile resources used by computer programs, often for software development. These may include configuration data, documentation, help data, message templates, pre-written code and subroutines, classes, values or type specifications. In IBM's OS/360 and its successors they are referred to as partitioned data sets.
A library is also a collection of implementations of behavior, written in terms of a language, that has a well-defined interface by which the behavior is invoked. For instance, people who want to write a higher level program can use a library to make system calls instead of implementing those system calls over and over again. In addition, the behavior is provided for reuse by multiple independent programs. A program invokes the library-provided behavior via a mechanism of the language. For example, in a simple imperative language such as C, the behavior in a library is invoked by using C's normal function-call. What distinguishes the call as being to a library function, versus being to another function in the same program, is the way that the code is organized in the system.
Library code is organized in such a way that it can be used by multiple programs that have no connection to each other, while code that is part of a program is organized to be used only within that one program. 
The value of a library lies in the reuse of the behavior. When a program invokes a library, it gains the behavior implemented inside that library without having to implement that behavior itself. Libraries encourage the sharing of code in a modular fashion, and ease the distribution of the code.
The behavior implemented by a library can be connected to the invoking program at different program lifecycle phases. If the code of the library is accessed during the build of the invoking program, then the library is called a static library.[1] An alternative is to build the executable of the invoking program and distribute that, independently of the library implementation. The library behavior is connected after the executable has been invoked to be executed, either as part of the process of starting the execution, or in the middle of execution. In this case the library is called a dynamic library (loaded at runtime). A dynamic library can be loaded and linked when preparing a program for execution, by the linker. Alternatively, in the middle of execution, an application may explicitly request that a module be loaded.
Most compiled languages have a standard library although programmers can also create their own custom libraries. Most modern software systems provide libraries that implement the majority of the system services. Such libraries have commoditized the services which a modern application requires. As such, most code used by modern applications is provided in these system libraries.

Framework	   (GITHUB)
framework nedir
Önceden hazırlanmış belirli standartlar halinde kütüphanelerin bulunduğu bir iskelettir. İhtiyaca göre projemizi o iskelete dahil edip inşa ederiz.
Framework, yazılım geliştiricilerin kullandığı önceden hazırlanmış kütüphanelerin bunluduğu ve bunlara yenilerini ekleyebileceği yapıların adıdır. Gelişmiş frameworklerde form kontrolü, veri tabanı bağlantısı, kullanıcı giriş çıkış, mail atma, tema motoru gibi kütüphaneler mevcuttur.
Frameworkler ayrıca MVC (Model, View, Controller) gibi bölümlerden oluşarak projenizin daha okunabilir düzenlenebilir olmasını sağlamaktadır.
Yapılan projelerin çoğunda aradan belirli bir zaman geçtikten sonra düzenlemek zorlaşır. Hem kodların artması hem de yazılan kodun unutulması revize sürecini uzatmakta. Bu yapılar Modelde veritabanı işlemlerini, Controllerda genel mekaniği, Viewda ise görünüm kodu içerdiği için müdahale edilmesi gereken yer tam olarak bulanabilmektedir. 

A framework, or software framework, is a platform for developing software applications. It provides a foundation on which software developers can build programs for a specific platform. For example, a framework may include predefined classes and functions that can be used to process input, manage hardware devices, and interact with system software. This streamlines the development process since programmers don't need to reinvent the wheel each time they develop a new application.
A framework is similar to an application programming interface (API), though technically a framework includes an API. As the name suggests, a framework serves as a foundation for programming, while an API provides access to the elements supported by the framework. A framework may also include code libraries, a compiler, and other programs used in the software development process.
Several different types of software frameworks exist. Popular examples include ActiveX and .NET for Windows development, Cocoa for Mac OS X, Cocoa Touch for iOS, and the Android Application Framework for Android. Software development kits (SDKs) are available for each of these frameworks and include programming tools designed specifically for the corresponding framework. For example, Apple's Xcode development software includes a Mac OS X SDK designed for writing and compiling applications for the Cocoa framework.

Ad Hoc Query	(GITHUB)  (test) 
Ad hoc nedir, ad hoc query nedir, ad-hoc query nedir
(ad hoc = amaca özel, niyete mahsus, latince) (Ad hoc is a Latin phrase meaning literally 'to this')
In SQL, an ad hoc query is a loosely typed command/query whose value depends upon some variable. 

Each time the command is executed, the result is different, depending on the value of the variable. It cannot be predetermined and usually comes under dynamic programming SQL query. An ad hoc query is short lived and is created at runtime.
Techopedia explains Ad Hoc Query
As the word "ad hoc" suggests, this type of query is designed for a "particular purpose,"which is in contrast to a predefined query, which has the same output value on every execution. An ad hoc query does not reside in the system for a long time and is created dynamically on demand by the user. It is more efficient to use an ad hoc query in programming as it saves system resources, but, at the same time complex, ad hoc queries (have multiple variables) also challenge the processing speed and runtime memory of the system.

.NET Framework    (GITHUB)
.NET nedir?
.NET Framework (pronounced as "dot net") is a software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows. It includes a large class library named as Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language interoperability (each language can use code written in other languages) across several programming languages. Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment (in contrast to a hardware environment) named the Common Language Runtime (CLR). The CLR is an application virtual machine that provides services such as security, memory management, and exception handling. As such, computer code written using .NET Framework is called "managed code". FCL and CLR together constitute the .NET Framework.

The .NET platform
.NET is a developer platform made up of tools, programming languages, and libraries for building many different types of applications.
The base platform provides components that apply to all different types of apps. Additional frameworks, such as ASP.NET, extend .NET with components for building specific types of apps.
Here are some things included in the .NET platform:
•	The C# programming language and its compilers
•	Base libraries for working with strings, dates, files/IO, and more
•	Editors and tools for Windows, Linux, macOS, and Docker

ADO   (ActiveX Data Objects)     (GITHUB) (test)
Ado nedir?
ADO can be used to access databases from your web pages.
What is ADO?
•	ADO is a Microsoft technology
•	ADO stands for ActiveX Data Objects
•	ADO is a Microsoft Active-X component
•	ADO is automatically installed with Microsoft IIS
•	ADO is a programming interface to access data in a database
ADO.NET is a data access technology from the Microsoft .NET Framework that provides communication between relational and non-relational systems through a common set of components.[1] ADO.NET is a set of computer software components that programmers can use to access data and data services from a database. It is a part of the base class library that is included with the Microsoft .NET Framework. It is commonly used by programmers to access and modify data stored in relational database systems, though it can also access data in non-relational data sources. ADO.NET is sometimes considered an evolution of ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) technology, but was changed so extensively that it can be considered an entirely new product.

UI (User Interface)   (GITHUB)
The user interface (UI) is the point of human-computer interaction and communication in a device. This can include display screens, keyboards, a mouse and the appearance of a desktop. It is also the way through which a user interacts with an application or a website. The growing dependence of many businesses on web applications and mobile applications has led many companies to place increased priority on UI in an effort to improve the user's overall experience.
Types of user interfaces
The various types of user interfaces include:
•	graphical user interface (GUI)
•	command line interface (CLI)
•	menu-driven user interface
•	touch user interface
•	voice user interface (VUI)
•	form-based user interface
•	natural language user interface
Examples of user interfaces
Some examples of user interfaces include:
•	computer mouse
•	remote control
•	virtual reality
•	ATMs
•	speedometer
•	the old iPod click wheel
Websites such as Airbnb, Dropbox and Virgin America display strong user interface design. Sites like these have created pleasant, easily operable, user-centered designs (UCD) that focus on the user and their needs.

In early computers, there was very little user interface except for a few buttons at an operator's console. Many of these early computers used punched cards, prepared using keypunch machines, as the primary method of input for computer programs and data. While punched cards have been essentially obsolete in computing since 2012, some voting machines still use a punched card system.
The user interface evolved with the introduction of the command line interface, which first appeared as a nearly blank display screen with a line for user input. Users relied on a keyboard and a set of commands to navigate exchanges of information with the computer. This command line interface led to one in which menus (lists of choices written in text) predominated.
Finally, the GUI arrived, originating mainly in Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), adopted and enhanced by Apple and effectively standardized by Microsoft in its Windows operating systems. Elements of a GUI include such things as windows, pull-down menus, buttons, scroll bars and icons. With the increasing use of multimedia as part of the GUI, sound, voice, motion video and virtual reality are increasingly becoming the GUI for many applications.

UI ve UX çoğu kez beraber kullanılmalarına rağmen aslında çok farklı iki alandır. UI konusunda olmasa bile UX konusunda çok geride olan ülkemizde, maalesef bu işi profesyonel olarak yapan insanlar bile aralarındaki farkı çok bilmiyorlar. Ülkemizde bir UXD (User Interface Designer) ile tanışmanız çok zor. Türkiye’de bu işle ilgili çoğu insanın özgeçmişinde “UI/UX” yazar. Bunun bir sebebi aralarındaki farkın bilinmemesi, diğer sebebi ise internet sektörünü geriden takip etmemizden dolayı bu işi iki parçaya bölmenin bir lüks olarak görünmesidir.

Kısaca bahsetmek gerekirse; UI, aslında arayüz tasarımıdır. Televizyon kumandasının üstündeki tuşlar, bir arayüz tasarımı örneğidir. Tuşların yerleri, büyüklüğü, renkleri tasarımcının verdiği kararlar sonucu uygulanır. Arayüz tasarımının internet sitelerindeki karşılığı ise butonlar, grid yapısı, mizanpaj, renkler, boşluklar gibi tüm grafik elemanlardan oluşan görsel tasarımdır. Zamanla internet sitelerindeki interaksiyon arttıkça, önceleri çok da önemsenmeyen arayüz tasarımı da gittikçe önemli bir hal aldı. Kullanıcıların sitede rahatça dolaşmaları ve hatta kalmalarını sağlamak için basit ve kullanılabilir bir arayüz artık şart. Kullanıcılar bir sitede dolaşmaya veya terk etmeye saniyeler içerisinde karar veriyorlar. Yoğun uğraşlarla sitenize yönlendirdiğiniz kullanıcıları sitenizde tutamadığınız zaman da maalesef tüm uğraşlarınız boşa gidiyor.
The emerging popularity of mobile applications has also affected UI, leading to something called mobile UI. Mobile UI is specifically concerned with creating usable, interactive interfaces on the smaller screens of smartphones and tablets and improving special features, like touch controls.

Instantiation vs Initialization	 	(GITHUB)  (test)
Instantiation nedir, instantiation nedir, initialization nedir, Initialization nedir

To initialize something is to set it to its initial value. To instantiate something is to create an instance of it.
-
Here I will explain difference between initialization and instantiation in c#, vb.net with example or instantiation vs initialization in asp.net or how to instantiate and initialize a class in asp.net using c#, vb.net with example. In c# or vb.net instantiation means declaring object for class and initialization means assigning values to variables or setting initial values.
(instance nedir)
(instance: In object-oriented programming (OOP), an instance is a concrete occurrence of any object, existing usually during the runtime of a computer program. Formally, "instance" is synonymous with "object" as they are each a particular value (realization), and these may be called an instance object; "instance" emphasizes the distinct identity of the object. The creation of an instance is called instantiation.)
(instance’ın kelime anlamına baktığımızda zaten anlıyoruz ki; instance bir class’a aittir. Çünkü instance şeyin “örneği” demektir. C# veya OOP’de neyin bir “örneği” olur? Tabi ki class’ın…  
(instance kelime anlamı: an example or single occurrence of something. Örnek Cümle: "a serious instance of corruption")
(initialization şuradan akla getirilebilir -> Gene kelime anlamına bakalım: 
Anlam: of or at the beginning:
“My initial surprise was soon replaced by delight.”
Anlam: the first letter of a name, especially when used to represent the whole name:
“He wrote his initials, P.M.R., at the bottom of the page.”
Görüldüğü gibi “ilk” anlamı var kelimenin. Biz bir değişkeni declare ettiğimizde onun değerini henüz vermemiş oluyoruz, sadece değişkeni declare etmiş oluyoruz. Ama onu “initialize” ettiğimizde; ona “ilk” değerini vermiş oluyoruz…
Int a;
Int a = 5;  “ilk değerini vermiş olduk. Yani initialization yapmış olduk. Mantıken, kelime anlamlarına baktığımızda burada bi “instantiation” görmüyoruz. Çünkü bir şeyi “örneklemiyoruz”. Bir class’tan örnekleme yapsaydık, yani yeni bir obje oluştursaydık, işte o zaman instantiation yapmış olacaktık”.

Description:
In previous posts I explained cursor in sql server with example, oops concepts in c# with examples, difference between dispose vs finalize method, difference between pageload and page_init in asp.net, constructors in c#, vb.net, delegates in c# with example and many articles relating to interview questions, asp.net, c#.net. Now I will explain difference between instantiation and initialization in c#, vb.net with example.

Initialization
Initialization means assigning initial value to variables while declaring.
Example of Initialization
Following is the simple example of initialization in application.
  int a;  //Declaration

  a = 10;  //Initialization

  or

  int a = 10;

Instantiation
Instantiation means defining or creating new object for class to access all properties like methods, operators, fields, etc. from class.

Following is the example of defining instantiation in application.
class sampleclass {
// your code
}
class Program
{
static void Main()
{
// Instantiating sampleclass
sampleclass sobj = new sampleclass();
}
}

If you observe above syntax we created new object by instantiating sampleclass class. By using new object sobj we can access all the methods and properties from sampleclass class.
I hope it helps you to understand difference between initialization and instantiation.

Aşağıda örnekli olarak bu üçlünün tanımı yapılmış

Declaration - Declaring a variable means to introduce a new variable to the program. You define its type and its name.

int a; //a is declared
Instantiate - Instantiating a class means to create a new instance of the class.
MyObject x = new MyObject(); //we are making a new instance of the class MyObject
Açıklama 2:
Instantiate literally means "to create an instance of". In programming, this generally means to create an instance of an object (generally on "the heap"). This is done via the new keyword in most languages. ie: new object();. Most of the time you will also save a reference to the object. ie: object myObject = new object();.


Initialize - To initialize a variable means to assign it an initial value.
Açıklama 2: 
Initialize means to give an initial value to. In some languages, if you don't initialize a variable it will have arbitrary (dirty/garbage) data in it. In C# it is actually a compile-time error to read from an uninitialized variable.

int a; //a is declared
int a = 0; //a is declared AND initialized to 0
MyObject x = new MyObject(); //x is declared and initialized with an instance of MyObject
Assigning - Assigning to a variable means to provide the variable with a value.

int a = 0; //we are assigning to a; yes, initializing a variable means you assign it a value, so they do overlap!
a = 1; //we are assigning to a

Assigning:
Assigning is simply the storing of one value to a variable. x = 5 assigns the value 5 to the variable  x. In some languages, assignment cannot be combined with declaration, but in C# it can be: int x = 5;.

Note that the statement object myObject = new object(); combines all four of these.

new object() instantiates a new object object, returning a reference to it.
object myObject declares a new object reference.
= initializes the reference variable by assigning the value of the reference to it.

SOLID Principles 	(GITHUB)
SOLID Principles nedir, solid nedir, SOLID nedir, single responsibility nedir, srp nedir, open closed nedir, open-closed nedir, open/closed nedir, open-closed principle nedir, open/closed principle nedir

S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Bir programdaki her class veya modül sadece tek bir görevi yerine getirmelidir, birden fazla görev bir class'a veya modüle atanmamalıdır. SRP bununla da sınırlı değildir olay. Yapılan bu tek görev, ilgili class tarafından enkapsüle edilmelidir, yani yapılan görev, işlemle ilgisi olmayan diğer class'lardan gizlenmelidir.
The single responsibility principle (SRP) states that every class or module in a program should have responsibility for just a single piece of that program's functionality. Further, the elements of that responsibility should be encapsulated by the responsible class rather than spread out in unrelated classes.
O: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Nesne genişlemeye (extension'a) açık, değişikliklere kapalı olmalıdır (modification).

L: Liskov ‘s Substitution Principle (LSP) 
Alt sınıflar, üst sınıflar ile yer değiştirdiğinde herhangi bir problem ortaya çıkmamalıdır, alt sınıf üst sınıf yerine kullanılabilmelidir. Gökhan gökalp açıklaması: Alt sınıftan türetilmiş nesneler, üst sınıftan türetilen nesnelerle yer değiştirdiklerinde yine aynı davranışı -herhangi bir problem çıkmadan- sergilemesi gerektiğini savunur.
“Aynı temel sınıftan türeyen tüm sınıflar, birbirlerinin yerine kullanılabilir olmalıdır. Bu yer değiştirme durumunda, sınıfa özel bir istisna kesinlikle oluşmamalıdır.”
I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Bir client, kullanmadığı metoda bağlı olmamalıdır. Bu, büyük bir interface'in küçük parçalara ayrılmasıyla ve bu yeni küçük interface'lerin implement edilmesiyle gerçekleştirilir.
D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
Üst sınıflar, alt sınıflara bağlı olmamalıdır. Hem üst, hem alt sınıflar abstraction'lara bağlı olmalıdır.

Abstract Class ve Interface Arasındaki Farklar Nelerdir?     (GITHUB)  (örnek)

https://medium.com/software-development-turkey/abstract-class-ve-interface-aras%C4%B1ndaki-farklar-nelerdir-3c0a4f956eba
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-abstract-class-and-interface-in-c-sharp/
 
Yazılıma yeni başlayan hemen herkesin zaman zaman karıştırdığı, hangisini ne zaman kullanacağına karar veremediği Abstract Class ve Interface ikilisini ele almak istedim. İlk bakışta yazdığımız koda oldukça benzer yetenekler kazandırdıkları görünse de aralarındaki farkların üzerinde durarak hangi senaryolarda hangisine karar vermemiz gerektiğini iyice açığa çıkartacağız 🙂
 
 
© agile-code.com
Abstract sınıflara geçmeden önce C# ve tüm Object Oriented dillerin bize sunduğu bir özellik olan abstraction(soyutlama) kavramını ele alalım. Böylece Abstract sınıflara ve Interface’lere neden ihtiyaç duyduğumuzu daha net bir şekilde anlayabiliriz.
Abstraction (Soyutlama) Nedir?
Abstraction, OOP (Object Oriented Programming-Nesne Tabanlı Programlama) içerisindeki önemli kavramlardan birisidir. C#’taki soyutlama; diğer Object Oriented dillerde olduğu gibi iç detayları gizleyerek sadece işlevleri göstermeye denir. Bu durumu gerçek hayatın içerisinden bir senaryo ile örneklendirelim.
Senaryo: Bir gün canınız sıkıldı ve çocukluğunuzda kalmış tatlı bir aktivite olan lunaparka gidip çarpışan arabaya binmek istediniz. Biletinizi aldınız ve seçtiğiniz arabaya oturup size gelen görevliye bileti teslim ettiniz. Görevli alana baktı ve araçları hareket ettirecek olan elektriği vermek için yeterli sayıda kişinin olduğuna karar verip bir düğmeye bastı. Görevlinin düğmeye basmasıyla çarpışan arabaların hareket etmesi için gerekli olan elektrik akımı verildi ve arabanız çalışır hale geldi. Direksiyonu, gaz pedalını ve freni kullanarak dilediğiniz şekilde aracı kullanmaya başladınız.
Şimdi gelin bu gerçek hayatın birebir içinden olan senaryodaki soyutlamaları (abstractions) inceleyelim. Böylece yazılım alanında da aslında aynı mantığın kullanıldığını ve soyutlamanın hayatımızı nasıl kolaylaştırdığını daha iyi anlamış olacağız.
Senaryoda Yer Alan Soyutlamalar(Abstractions): İlk soyutlama örneğimiz biletinizi teslim ettiğiniz görevlinin eğlenceyi başlatmak için bastığı küçük kırmızı düğme 🙂 Görevli o kırmızı düğmeye bastığında bizler sadece eğlencenin başlayacağını biliyoruz, görevli de on dakikalık bir seansa daha start vereceğini biliyor yalnızca. Düğmeye basıldığı anda elektrik devresindeki anahtarın kapanıp akımın başlayacağını ne biz ne de görevli aklının ucundan dahi geçirmiyor. İşte bu tam bir soyutlama örneği. Yalnızca input(düğmeye basmak) ve output(eğlencenin başlaması) değerleriyle ilgileniyoruz. Arka tarafta dönen teknik hadiseleri hiç düşünmeden bize sunulmuş bir düğmeyi kullanarak işimizi görüyoruz.
Eğer hala bir şeyler oturmadıysa kafanızda bir de çarpışan arabamızdaki soyutlamaya bakalım. Siz arabayı kullanırken direksiyonu gitmek istediğiniz yöne çeviriyor, gaz pedalına basarak ilerliyorsunuz. Gaz pedalına bastığınızdaki motorda oluşan tetiklenmeleri, direksiyonu çevirdiğinizde lastiklerin dönmesini sağlayan mekanizmayı hiç düşünmeden yalnızca iki pedal bir direksiyonla aslında arka planında onlarca aksiyon yatan bir işlevi gerçekleştirmiş oluyorsunuz. Input (gaz/fren pedalları, direksiyon) ve output (arabanın gitmesi) değerlerini bilmek size yetiyor.
Object Oriented programlamada sınıfların soyutlanmasını ise Abstract Class ve Interface ikilisi sağlamaktadır. Abstraction kavramı kafamızda biraz olsun şekillendiğine göre şimdi Abstract Class’ları inceleyebiliriz.
Abstract Class
Abstract sınıflar sınıf hiyerarşisinde genellikle base class (temel sınıf) tanımlamak için kullanılan ve soyutlama yeteneği kazandıran sınıflardır. Bir sınıfı abstract yapmak için abstract keywordünü kullanırız. Abstract sınıflar en az bir tane abstract metod bulundurması bir best practice’tir.

abstract class Yazdir{     public abstract void KonsolaYazdir();}
Yukarıda Yazdir isimli basitçe bir abstract sınıfı tanımladık ve kendisinden türeyecek metodların override edeceği KonsolaYazdir() abstract metodunu oluşturduk.
Genel olarak abstract sınıfların özelliklerini bir araya toplarsak;
•	Abstract sınıfları genel olarak inheritance (kalıtım) uygularken kullanırız.
•	new anahtar sözcüğü ile nesneleri oluşturulamaz.
•	İçerisinde değişken ve metod bulundurabilir.
•	Abstract sınıflardan türetilen sınıfların abstract metodları implement etmesi zorunludur. Diğer metodları override etmeden de kullanabilir.
•	Constructors (yapıcı metodlar) ve destructors (yıkıcı metodlar) bulundurabilirler.
•	Static tanımlanamazlar. ( Tanımlanmaya çalışılırsa compiler “an abstract class cannot be sealed or static” hatası verir)
•	Bir sınıf yalnızca bir abstract sınıfı inheritance yoluyla implement edebilir. Çoklu kalıtım (multiple inheritance) desteklenmez.
•	Abstract olmayan metodları da bulundurabilir.
•	Kendisinden inherit alacak sınıflar ile arasında “is-a” ilişkisi vardır. (Burası ilk başlarda çok önemsenmeyen ancak hangi senaryoda Abstract hangi senaryoda Interface kullanacağımızı netleştirmede bize oldukça yardımcı olan bir detaydır, hemen aşağıda açıklamasını bulabilirsiniz)
Is-a İlişkisi Nedir?
Senaryomuzdan bir örnekle bunun daha iyi anlaşılabileceğini düşünüyorum. (Şimdiye kadar Türkçe kelimeler üzerinden gittiğim için örneğimde de is-a ilişkisi hariç cümlemi Türkçe kuruyorum)

Çarpışan araba is-a araba.
Yani en nihayetinde çarpışan araba da bir arabadır ve arabanın sahip olduğu özellikleri bünyesinde barındırır.
Şimdi Araba için abstract bir sınıf oluşturup çarpışan arabayı da bu sınıftan inherit alarak oluşturalım.

abstract class Araba{    
//Arabalarin ortak ozelliklerini burada tanimliyoruz    
public string Marka { get; set; }    
public int MaksimumHiz { get; set; }    
public string Tur { get; set; }
//Her araba icin yolculuga baslandi bilgisini farkli bir sekilde
//ekrana yazdirmak icin override  dilecek abstract metodumuzu yaziyoruz
public abstract void YolculugaBasla();
}

class CarpisanAraba : Araba{    
//Abstract metodumuzu carpisan arabaya ozel bir sekilde override      ediyoruz.    
public override void YolculugaBasla(){        Console.WriteLine("Carpisan araba ile yolculuga baslandi");    }
}
Araba isminde bir abstract sınıf tanımlayarak CarpisanAraba sınıfını bu abstract base sınıftan türettik. 
Böylece Araba sınıfında yer alan tüm özellikleri tekrardan yazmak zorunda kalmadan kolayca sahip olurken, YolculugaBasla() metodunu sınıfımıza özel override ettik. 
Abstract sınıfları inherit alan sınıfların abstract metodları override etmesinin zorunlu olduğunu belirtmiştik. Bu sebeple Visual Studio’da CarpisanAraba sınıfını Araba sınıfından inherit ettiğinizde, YolculugaBasla() metodunu override etmezseniz hata alırsınız.
Abstract sınıfları genel itibariyle mercek altına aldığımıza göre şimdi bir de Interface’leri inceleyelim. Sonrasında ikisi arasındaki farkları tablo halinde gördüğümüzde hangi senaryoda hangi soyutlama mekanizmasını kullanacağımızı çok daha iyi kestirebilir bir hale geleceğiz.
Interface
Interface, içerisinde sadece kendisinden türeyecek olan sınıfların içini dolduracağı metod tanımlarının bulunduğu ve soyutlama yapmamıza olanak sağlayan bir yapıdır. Interface’leri tanımlarken interface keyword'ünü kullanırız. Tanımladığımız yapının interface olduğunu belirtmek için isminin önüne I harfini getirmek bir best-practice olacaktır. Böylece kodlama yaparken inherit aldığımız yapının bir class mı yoksa interface mi olduğunu kolaylıkla ayırt edebiliriz. Bu kadar teorik bilgiden sonra basitçe bir interface tanımlayalım.

interface ILog{    void LogEkle(string kayit);}
Bu interface’ten türeyen tüm sınıflar LogEkle(string kayit) metodunu implement etmek zorundadır. Interface hakkında internette bir arama yaptığınızda genellikle kendisini inherit alan sınıflar için bir kontrat olduğundan bahsedilir. Kontrat kelimesiyle anlatılmak istenen tam olarak budur. Türeyen sınıflar, interface’in içerisinde yer alan tüm metodları implement edeceğine dair bir söz vermekte, sözleşme yapmaktadır. Aksi halde derleyici hata verecek, kodunuz çalışmayacaktır.
Genel olarak Interface’lerin özelliklerinden bahsetmemiz gerekirse;
•	new keywordü ile nesneleri oluşturulamaz.
•	Bir sınıfın ne yapması gerektiğini belirtir, nasıl yapması gerektiğini değil.
•	Default olarak tüm Interface üyeleri abstract ve public olarak tanımlanır. Sizin özellikle belirtmeniz gerekmez.
•	Bir sınıf birden fazla interface’i inherit edebilir, çoklu kalıtım (multiple-inheritance) desteklenir.
•	İçerisinde yalnızca metodların imzaları yer alır, içi dolu metod bulunduramazlar.
•	Kendisinden inherit alacak sınıflar ile arasında “can-do” ilişkisi vardır.
Can-do İlişkisi Nedir?
Çarpışan araba senaryosundan bir örnekle açıklamak gerekirse,
Çarpışan araba can-do hızlanmak. 
Açıklamaya gerek var mı bilemedim açıkçası ama abstract sınıflarda açıklamışken burada boş bırakmak içime sinmezdi. Çarpışan araba hızlanabilir diyoruz. Çarpışan arabanın bir davranışından bahsediyoruz.
Interfaceleri tam olarak can-do ilişkileri içeren yapılarda kullanmamız isabetli olacaktır. Senaryomuzdaki çarpışan araba hızlanabilir. Bu çarpışan arabanın yapabileceği bir kabiliyetigöstermektedir. Can-do ilişkisi davranışları, kabiliyetleri belirtir. Bu kabiliyetin interface içerisinde tanımlanması çok daha doğru olacaktır.

BU da iyi açıklama:
An abstract class is a way to achieve the abstraction in C#. An Abstract class is never intended to be instantiated directly. This class must contain at least one abstract method, which is marked by the keyword or modifier abstract in the class definition. The Abstract classes are typically used to define a base class in the class hierarchy.


Example:

// C# program to illustrate the 
// concept of abstract class 
using System; 
   
public abstract class G { 
    public abstract void gfg1(); 
} 

public class G1 : G { 
  
    // abstract method 'gfg1()' 
    // declare here with 
    // 'override' keyword 
    public override void gfg1() 
    { 
        Console.WriteLine("Class name is G1"); 
    } 
} 
  
// class 'G' inherit in 
// another child class 'G2' 
public class G2 : G { 
  
    // same as the previous class 
    public override void gfg1() 
    { 
        Console.WriteLine("Class name is  G2"); 
    } 
} 
  
// Driver Class 
public class main_method { 
  
    // Main Method 
    public static void Main() 
    { 
  
        // 'obj' is object of class 
        // 'G' class ' 
        // G' cannot 
        // be instantiate 
        G obj; 
  
        // instantiate class 'G1' 
        obj = new G1(); 
  
        // call 'gfg1()' of class 'G1' 
        obj.gfg1(); 
  
        // instantiate class 'G2' 
        obj = new G2(); 
  
        // call 'gfg1()' of class 'G2' 
        obj.gfg1(); 
    } 
} 
Output :



Class name is G1
Class name is  G2

Like a class, Interface can have methods, properties, events, and indexers as its members. But interfaces will contain only the declaration of the members. The implementation of interface’s members will be given by the class who implements the interface implicitly or explicitly.

Example:

// C# program to illustrate the 
// concept of interface 
using System; 
  
// A simple interface 
interface interface1 { 
  
    // method having only declaration 
    // not definition 
    void show(); 
} 
  
// A class that implements the interface. 
class MyClass : interface1 { 
  
    // providing the body part of function 
    public void show() 
    { 
        Console.WriteLine("Welcome to GeeksforGeeks!!!"); 
    } 
  
    // Main Method 
    public static void Main(String[] args) 
    { 
  
        // Creating object 
        MyClass obj1 = new MyClass(); 
  
        // calling method 
        obj1.show(); 
    } 
} 
Output:
Welcome to GeeksforGeeks!!!
Difference between Abstract Class and Interface
ABSTRACT CLASS	INTERFACE
It contains both declaration and definition part.	It contains only a declaration part.
Multiple inheritance is not achieved by abstract class.	Multiple inheritance is achieved by interface.
It contain constructor.
It does not contain constructor.

It can contain static members.	It does not contain static members.
It can contain different types of access modifiers like public, private, protected etc.	It only contains public access modifier because everything in the interface is public.
The performance of an abstract class is fast.	The performance of interface is slow because it requires time to search actual method in the corresponding class.
It is used to implement the core identity of class.	It is used to implement peripheral abilities of class.
A class can only use one abstract class.	A class can use multiple interface.
If many implementations are of the same kind and use common behavior, then it is superior to use abstract class.	If many implementations only share methods, then it is superior to use Interface.
Abstract class can contain methods, fields, constants, etc.	Interface can only contain methods .
It can be fully, partially or not implemented.	It should be fully implemented.

RESTful API  
(representational state transfer)    (GITHUB)
Restful api nedir?
A RESTful API is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data.

A RESTful API -- also referred to as a RESTful web service -- is based on representational state transfer (REST) technology, an architectural style and approach to communications often used in web services development.

REST technology is generally preferred to the more robust Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) technology because REST leverages less bandwidth, making it more suitable for internet usage. An API for a website is code that allows two software programs to communicate with each another . The API spells out the proper way for a developer to write a program requesting services from an operating system or other application.

Method Signature 	(GITHUB)
Method Signature nedir

the method signature for your method is:

DoSomething(int, int)

(Yani bir method signature şunlardan oluşur: metod adı, parametrelerin tipi)

Return type is not part of the method signature in C#. Only the method name and its parameters types (but not the parameter names) are part of the signature. You cannot, for example, have these two methods:

int DoSomething(int a, int b);
string DoSomething(int a, int b);

To be clear: Methods cannot be overloaded based on their return type. They must have a unique name, unique parameter types, or pass their arguments differently (e.g. using out or ref).

Edit: To answer your original question, the method signature for your method is:
DoSomething(int, int)
Note that this all applies to normal methods. If you're talking about delegates, then you should see keyboardP's answer. (Short version: return type IS part of the signature for a delegate).

Detay:
Is the return type is a part of signature or not?
It depends on why you are asking the question. Why do you care?
There are two definitions of method signature. The C# language definition does not include the return type, and uses the signature of the method to determine whether two overloads are allowed. Two methods with the same signature are not allowed in a type. Since C# does not consider the return type to be a part of the signature, C# does not allow two methods that differ only in return type to be declared in the same type.
The CLR, however, does include the return type in the signature. The CLR allows for two methods to be in the same type that differ only in return type.
To be more specific: in C# the signature consists of the methods:
•	name
•	number of type parameters
•	number of formal parameters
•	type of each formal parameter
•	out/ref/value-ness of each formal parameter
with the following additional notes:
•	generic type parameter constraints are not part of the signature
•	return type is not part of the signature
•	type parameter and formal parameter names are not part of the signature
•	two methods may not differ only in out/ref
In the CLR the signature consists of:
•	name
•	number of type parameters
•	number of formal parameters
•	type of each formal parameter including modopts and modreqs
•	return type including modopts and modreqs
•	ref/value-ness of each formal parameter
Note that the CLR does not distinguish between "ref int" and "out int" at all when considering signatures. Note that the CLR does distinguish between modopt/modreq types. (The way that the C# compiler deals with modopt/modreq types is too complex to summarize here.)

Method Overriding (Override) (GITHUB)
method overriding nedir, override nedir

Method Overriding
 
Overriding can be defined as: being able to change or augment the behavior of methods in classes, known as overriding their logic; it is one of the most powerful aspects of Object Oriented Programming.
Explanation
Suppose you have a Phone, no please don’t suppose everyone has a phone today, although some people even have more than one. Okay leave it, so if you have phone:

Then there must be ring facility in it:
 
Now your phone can be of any type, like it can be cellular, satellite or landline, these all types of phones will also have the same or a different functionality (based on their attribute).
 
Now whenever you receive a call, the caller doesn’t know whether you have a cellular phone, landline phone or anything else, he/she just calls you and according to that call operation your phone rings. In the case of method overriding, your phone works as a class and the ring is the functionality.

Keywords in Method Overriding
 
There are the following 3 types of keywords used in C# for method overriding.
 
Override Keyword
In the subclass, it tells the compiler that this method is overriding the same named method in the base class.
1.	public override int myValue()  
2.	{  
3.	     -  
4.	     -  
5.	     -  
6.	}  
Base Keyword
 
In the subclass, it calls the base class method for overriding functionality.
1.	base.myValue();  
Method Overriding Example
1.	using System;  
2.	using System.Collections.Generic;  
3.	using System.Linq;  
4.	using System.Text;  
5.	namespace Hello_Word  
6.	{  
7.	    class baseClass  
8.	    {  
9.	        public virtual void Greetings()  
10.	        {  
11.	            Console.WriteLine("baseClass Saying Hello!");  
12.	        }  
13.	    }  
14.	    class subClass : baseClass  
15.	    {  
16.	        public override void Greetings()  
17.	        {  
18.	            base.Greetings();  
19.	            Console.WriteLine("subClass Saying Hello!");  
20.	        }  
21.	    }  
22.	    class Program  
23.	    {  
24.	        static void Main(string[] args)  
25.	        {  
26.	            baseClass obj1 = new subClass();  
27.	            obj1.Greetings();  
28.	            Console.ReadLine();  
29.	        }  
30.	    }  
31.	}  
  
 
An output window is showing that baseClass will get called first and then subclass. If we make certain changes in this code like:
1.	base.Greetings();  
2.	Console.WriteLine("subClass Saying Hello!"); // current scenario  
After making a few modifications as in the following:
1.	Console.WriteLine("subClass Saying Hello!");  
2.	base.Greetings(); // after modifications  
Now our output will be like this:
 

 

If we remove "base.Greetings();" then the compiler will not call the baseclass as in the following:
1.	using System;  
2.	using System.Collections.Generic;  
3.	using System.Linq;  
4.	using System.Text;  
5.	namespace Hello_Word  
6.	{  
7.	    class baseClass  
8.	    {  
9.	        public virtual void Greetings()  
10.	        {  
11.	            Console.WriteLine("baseClass Saying Hello!");  
12.	        }  
13.	    }  
14.	    class subClass : baseClass  
15.	    {  
16.	        public override void Greetings()  
17.	        {  
18.	            Console.WriteLine("subClass Saying Hello!");  
19.	            // base.Greetings();  
20.	        }  
21.	    }  
22.	    class Program  
23.	    {  
24.	        static void Main(string[] args)  
25.	        {  
26.	            baseClass obj1 = new subClass();  
27.	            obj1.Greetings();  
28.	            Console.ReadLine();  
29.	        }  
30.	    }  
31.	}  
  
 
Now making some other changes, like placing:
1.	baseClass obj1 = new baseClass();  
2.	obj1.Greetings();  
Instead of:
1.	baseClass obj1 = new subClass();  
2.	obj1.Greetings();  

Now let’s check the output window, what’s its showing now:
 
  
 
So as you are seeing that now its calling only the baseClass. So now I guess you will be a little closer to the method overriding functionality.

Method Overriding is a technique that allows the invoking of functions from another class (base class) in the derived class. Creating a method in the derived class with the same signature as a method in the base class is called as method overriding.

Bi örnek yaptım. Override'siz metot da çalışıyor hata vermiyor. Benim aşağıdaki kodda incelediğim durum şu linkte de inceleniyor: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-sharp-method-overriding/
    class Program
    {
        class BaseClass
        {
            public virtual void SampleMethod()
            {
                Console.WriteLine("base");
            }

            public void SecondMethod()
            {
                Console.WriteLine("SecondMethod-Base");
            }
        }

        class DerivedClass : BaseClass
        {
            public override void SampleMethod()
            {
                Console.WriteLine("derived");
            }

            public void SecondMethod()
            {
                Console.WriteLine("SecondMethod-DerivedClass");
            }
        }
        class Main_Method
        {
            static void Main()
            {
                DerivedClass d = new DerivedClass();
                d.SampleMethod();

                BaseClass b = new DerivedClass();
                b.SampleMethod();

                BaseClass bc = new BaseClass();
                bc.SampleMethod();

                Console.WriteLine("-");
                d.SecondMethod();
                b.SecondMethod();
                bc.SecondMethod();
            }
        }
    }

Method Overriding in C# is similar to the virtual function in C++. Method Overriding is a technique that allows the invoking of functions from another class (base class) in the derived class. Creating a method in the derived class with the same signature as a method in the base class is called as method overriding.
In simple words, Overriding is a feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes. When a method in a subclass has the same name, same parameters or signature and same return type(or sub-type) as a method in its super-class, then the method in the subclass is said to override the method in the super-class. Method overriding is one of the ways by which C# achieve Run Time Polymorphism(Dynamic Polymorphism).
The method that is overridden by an override declaration is called the overridden base method. An override metho d is a new implementation of a member that is inherited from a base class. The overridden base method must be virtual, abstract, or override.
 
Example:
class base_class
{
    public void gfg();
}

class derived_class : base_class
{
    public void gfg();
}

class Main_Method
{
 static void Main()
 {
    derived_class d = new derived_class();
    d.gfg();
 }
}
Here the base class is inherited in the derived class and the method gfg() which has the same signature in both the classes, is overridden.

Interface 	(GITHUB)
Interface nedir, interface nedir
An interface defines a contract. Any class or struct that implements that contract must provide an implementation of the members defined in the interface. Beginning with C# 8.0, an interface may define a default implementation for members. It may also define static members in order to provide a single implementation for common functionality.
In the following example, class ImplementationClass must implement a method named SampleMethod that has no parameters and returns void.
For more information and examples, see Interfaces.
Example
interface ISampleInterface
{
    void SampleMethod();
}

class ImplementationClass : ISampleInterface
{
    // Explicit interface member implementation:
    void ISampleInterface.SampleMethod()
    {
        // Method implementation.
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        // Declare an interface instance.
        ISampleInterface obj = new ImplementationClass();

        // Call the member.
        obj.SampleMethod();
    }
}
An interface can be a member of a namespace or a class. An interface declaration can contain declarations (signatures without any implementation) of the following members:
•	Methods
•	Properties
•	Indexers
•	Events
These preceding member declarations typically do not contain a body. Beginning with C# 8.0, an interface member may declare a body. This is called a default implementation. Members with bodies permit the interface to provide a "default" implementation for classes and structs that don't provide an overriding implementation. In addition, beginning with C# 8.0, an interface may include:
•	Constants
•	Operators
•	Static constructor.
•	Nested types
•	Static fields, methods, properties, indexers, and events
•	Member declarations using the explicit interface implementation syntax.
•	Explicit access modifiers (the default access is public).
Interfaces may not contain instance state. While static fields are now permitted, instance fields are not permitted in interfaces. Instance auto-properties are not supported in interfaces, as they would implicitly declare a hidden field. This rule has a subtle effect on property declarations. In an interface declaration, the following code does not declare an auto-implemented property as it does in a class or struct. Instead, it declares a property that doesn't have a default implementation but must be implemented in any type that implements the interface:

public interface INamed
{
  public string Name {get; set;}
}
An interface can inherit from one or more base interfaces. When an interface overrides a method implemented in a base interface, it must use the explicit interface implementation syntax.
When a base type list contains a base class and interfaces, the base class must come first in the list.
A class that implements an interface can explicitly implement members of that interface. An explicitly implemented member cannot be accessed through a class instance, but only through an instance of the interface. In addition, default interface members can only be accessed through an instance of the interface.
For more information about explicit interface implementation, see Explicit Interface Implementation.
Example
The following example demonstrates interface implementation. In this example, the interface contains the property declaration and the class contains the implementation. Any instance of a class that implements IPoint has integer properties x and y.
interface IPoint
{
   // Property signatures:
   int X
   {
      get;
      set;
   }

   int Y
   {
      get;
      set;
   }

   double Distance
   {
       get;
   }
}

class Point : IPoint
{
   // Constructor:
   public Point(int x, int y)
   {
      X = x;
      Y = y;
   }

   // Property implementation:
   public int X { get; set; }

   public int Y { get; set; }

   // Property implementation
   public double Distance =>
      Math.Sqrt(X * X + Y * Y);

}

class MainClass
{
   static void PrintPoint(IPoint p)
   {
      Console.WriteLine("x={0}, y={1}", p.X, p.Y);
   }

   static void Main()
   {
      IPoint p = new Point(2, 3);
      Console.Write("My Point: ");
      PrintPoint(p);
   }
}
// Output: My Point: x=2, y=3

An interface is a completely abstract class, which contains only abstract members.
It is declared using the interface keyword:

        public interface IShape
        {
            void Draw();
        }

All members of the interface are by default abstract, so no need to use the abstract keyword. 
Also, all members of an interface are always public, and no access modifiers can be applied to them.
It is common to use the capital letter I as the starting letter for an interface name.
Interfaces can contain properties, methods, etc. but cannot contain fields (variables).
When a class implements an interface, it must also implement, or define, all of its methods.
The term implementing an interface is used (opposed to the term "inheriting from") to describe the process of creating a class based on an interface. The interface simply describes what a class should do. The class implementing the interface must define how to accomplish the behaviors.
The syntax to implement an interface is the same as that to derive a class: 

        public interface IShape
        {
            void Draw();
        }
        class Circle : IShape
        {
            public void Draw()
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Circle Draw");
            }
        }
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            IShape c = new Circle();
            c.Draw();
            //Outputs "Circle Draw"
        }

Note, that the override keyword is not needed when you implement an interface.

But why use interfaces rather than abstract classes? 
A class can inherit from just one base class, but it can implement multiple interfaces!
Therefore, by using interfaces you can include behavior from multiple sources in a class.
To implement multiple interfaces, use a comma separated list of interfaces when creating the class: class A: IShape, IAnimal, etc.

Merhaba,
Önceki yazılarımda SOLID prensiplerinden S–Tek Sorumluluk Prensibi(Single Responsibility Principle – SRP)‘ni ve O–Açık Kapalı Prensibi(Open Closed Principle – OCP) incelemiştik. Bu yazımızda ise sıradaki L timsaline denk gelen Liskov’un Yerine Geçme Prensibi(Liskov Substitution Principle – LSP) izah edeceğim.
Liskov’un Yerine Geçme Prensibi, diğerlerine göre anlaşılması en zor prensiptir diyebilirim. Barbara Liskov adlı hanımefendi tarafından 1988 yılında ‘Data Abstraction and Hierarchy’ isimli kitabında bu prensip gündeme getirilmiştir.
Her zor konuda olduğu gibi haliyle bu konuda “aslınnda anlaşıldığında çook basitt” diyeceğimiz bir konudur. Lakin bu konuyu zorlaştıran Barbara Liskov’un konuyla alakalı yaptığı açıklamadır. Bunun yanında 2. ve 3. kaynakların konuyu daha basit seviyede anlaşılır bir üslupla ele almalarıdır. Ee son olarakda bizim nam-ı diğer Türkler’in üzerine cila çekmesidir.
Tabi yukarıdaki paragrafta anlattığım durum, kitaplardan ya da makalelerden konuyu okuyarak tek başına öğrenme gayretinde bulunanlar içindir. Eğer alanında uzman bir eğiticiden 1. dereceden eğitim alarak ilgili konuya fakıf olmuşsanız burada yazdıklarıma hak vermemeniz gayet doğal olacaktır.
Velhasıl, bu zorlu ama anlaşılmayı bekleyen konuyu bu makale sonunda net bir şekilde idrak edeceğinizi umuyorum. Tabi öncelikle kitaplarda ve konuyla ilgili makalelerde kafamızı karıştıran tanımlamalara ve yorumlara yer vererek konuya giriş yapıyorum.
Nedir Bu Liskov’un Yerine Geçme Prensibi
LSP’yi orataya atan Barbara Liskov öncülüğünde bir çok kişi ilgili konuyu açıklamaya çalışmış, doğal olarak farklı yaklaşımlardan dolayı farklı izahlar ortaya çıkmıştır. Şimdi bunların bir kısmına göz atalım.
Barbara Liskov’a göre;
Aranan yer değiştirme özelliği şöyle tanımlanabilir: T cinsinden parametre alan tüm programlar (fonksiyonlar) P olacak şekilde, S tipinde o1 nesnesi ve T tipinde o2 nesnesi olsun. Eğer o1 ile o2 nesneleri yer değiştirdiğinde P’nin davranışı değişmiyorsa S tipi T tipinin alt tipidir!
Evet, bende bişey anlamadım.
Bilimsel olarak matematik ile formülüze bir şekilde LSP’ye açıklama getirmişler. O açıklamaya göreyse;
q(x) fonksiyonu T tipindeki x nesnesi için kanıtlanabilirdir. O halde T tipinin alt tipi olan S tipindeki y nesnesi için de q(y) fonksiyonu kanıtlanabilir olmalıdır.
Evet, bundanda bişey anlamadığımız aşikar.
‘Uncle Bob’ lakaplı Robert Cecil Martin ise LSP’yi daha anlaşılır bir vaziyette aşağıdaki gibi izah etmiştir;
Temel sınıfın(base class) işaretçisini(pointer) ya da referansını kullanan fonksiyonlar, bu sınıftan türemiş olan sınıfları(derived class) da ekstra bilgiye ihtiyaç duymaksızın kullanabilmelidir.
Ehhh… Biraz daha yazılımcıya uygun bir açıklama olmuş gibi. En azından base classlar derived classlar derken kafada bişeylerin hayalini kurabiliyoruz. O kadar literatür taradım, kaynak okudum ama şu yukarıdaki açıklamanın bana polimorfizmi anımsattığı kadar kimse gıram bahsetmemiş. Haliyle algıladığımdan şüphelenir oldum. Eğer kaçırdığım bir mana, bir kelime yahut edat bağlaç varsa haber verinde neden yanlış anlamışım farkına varmama yardımcı olun.
Siz bana Uncle Bob’un sözündeki algı hatamı izah edene kadar benim şu kanaatte olduğumu bilmenizi isterim ki, bu yukarıdaki açıklamaların hiçbirinden bir cacık olmaz! Anlamak için anlaşılır bir açıklama gerek. Koskoca prensibi batı algısıyla özetleyecez derken aman dikkat önemsizleştirmeyelim!
Şimdi konuya şahsen girmeden önce bizim Türkler’in konuya getirdikleri açıklamalara göz atalım. (Adreslerini verdiğim yerli yazılımcılar konuyla ilgili araştırma yaparken internette tesadüfen denk geldiklerimdir.)
Ömer İşıker;
Temel sınıfta aşağıdaki sınıflara ait özel fonksiyon vs bulunmamalıdır. Yani temel sınıfta türemiş sınıflardan hiç biri için özel bir şey yazılmış olmamalıdır.
Bu açıklama Ömer İşıker tarafından şu adresteki LSP ile ilgili makalede yer almaktadır. Kanaatimce LSP’ye izahatte bulunmamızı sağlayan yeterli bir açıklama değildir.
Türkay Ürkmez;
Aynı temel sınıftan türeyen tüm sınıflar, birbirlerinin yerine kullanılabilir olmalıdır. Bu yer değiştirme durumunda, sınıfa özel bir istisna kesinlikle oluşmamalıdır.
Şahsi kanaatim, konuya en iyi açıklama getiren Türk yazarımız Türkay Ürkmez’dir. Türkay Ürkmez’in konuyla ilgili makalesi için tıklayınız.
Bir adette ekşi sözlükte konuya izahatte bulunan arkadaşımızın düşüncesini görelim.
yeni bir istek geldi müşteriden, sen de bunu sağlamak için mevcut olan bir class’ten child class üretiyorsun, veyahut method’ları override ediyorsun. mevcut class yerine child class’i kullandığında bir hata oluşmamalı ya da worst case’de çıkan hata, bütün uygulamayı darmadağın etmemeli. türetilmiş sınıflar (ihtiyaç üzerine method’ları override edilmiş ya da extend edilmiş), türetilikleri class’ler ile değiştirilebilir olmalıdır kısaca.
Evet, bu arkadaşımız bayağı uçuk bir izahatte bulunmuşlar. Kanımca LSP’yi ya anlamamış ya da “sttir et LPS’yi… bakın ben terminoloji biliyorum” diye duyurma derdinde. Ha konuyla alakasını sorarsanız eksilerde tabi… Entrye buradan ulaşabilirsiniz.
Daha sürüsüne bereket Türk yazılım geliştirici tarafından ilgili konu ele alınmıştır. Fazla kafa karıştırmak istemediğim için alıntılarda bunlarla yetiniyorum  
Şimdi LSP’yi kendimiz ele alalım.
Barbara Liskov’un ortaya attığı bu prensibe göre üst sınıf ile alt sınıf arasında davranış olarak hiçbir fark olmamalıdır. Yani birbirlerinin yerine kullanılabilmelidirler.
Düşünün ki, arabanıza bir klima düğmesi koydunuz ve onu işlevsiz bıraktınız. Yani görüntüden ibaret ama iş yok. İşte bu durum LSP’ye aykırıdır. LSP, Dummy Code(Sahte kod) dediğimiz bu tarz duruma hayır demektedir. Yani bir düğme varsa işlevide olmalıdır. Buradan yola çıkarsak eğer base classların(kalıtım veren sınıfların), derived classlardaki(kalıtım alan sınıflardaki) işlevselliği tam olarak yerine getirdiğinden emin olmalıyız.
Eee peki ne anlatmaya çalışıyoruz. Bir sınıfta bulunan herhangi bir işlev, kendisinden kalıtım alan sınıflarda kullanılmayacaksa eğer işte bu durum LSP’ye aykırı bir durumdur.
Örnek olarak şöyle bir senaryo çizelim.
Bir ordumuz olsun. Ordumuzdaki uçaklar bir yandan keşife çıkabilsin bir yandan da hedefi vurabilsin.

Yeni uçağımızın hedefi vurma özelliği yoktur. Lakin IUcak arayüzümüz tüm elemanları zorla uygulatmaktadır. Eee haliyle base class var olan HedefiVur metodunu derived classta kullanmayacağız. İşte yeni uçağımız(UcakD) için burada HedefiVur metodu Dummy Code yapısındadır.
Peki “HedefiVur” metodunu UcakD’de kullanmayacaksak aşağıdaki gibi önlem almalıyız.

            {
                u.HedefiVur();
            }
        });
    }
}
Yukarıdaki işlem dışında UcakD’de HedefiVur çağrıldığı zaman hata fırlatılıp “Savas” sınıfımızda try catch bloklarıyla kontrol sağlanabilir.
Tabi bunlar konumuzun dışında kalan konulardır. Asıl mevzu LSP’yi ilgilendiren base classtaki kullanılmayacak kodu derived class’a zorla implement etmektir. Haliyle LSP’ye aykırı olan bu durum OCP‘ye de aykırıdır. Çünkü her yeni gelen ve hedefi vuramayan uçakta “Savas” sınıfı içerisinde yeni if – else bloklarıyla kontrol sağlamız gerekecektir. Buda değişiklik demektir.
Gelin şimdi bu sorunu Liskov’un Yerine Geçme Prensibini uygulayarak çözelim.

Class Diyagramında görüldüğü gibi herşey açık ve net. Tasarımımızı LSP’ye uygun bir vaziyette şekillendirebilmek için gördüğünüz gibi base classtaki tüm işlevler farklı arayüzlere bölmüş bulunmaktayım. Bu yaptığımız işlem bir sonraki yazımda ele alacağım arayüz ayrım prensibinede uyarlı bir yaklaşımdır.
“UcakA”, “UcakB” ve “UcakC” hedefi vurma ve keşif yapma özelliklerine sahip oldukları için iki arayüzden de kalıtım almaktadırlar. “UcakD” ise sadece keşif yapabileceği için sadece “IUcakKesif” arayüzünden kalıtım almaktadır. Bu sayede kullanmayacağı bir işlev olan HedefiVur metodunu barındırmak zorunda kalmayacak ve Dummy Code durumunuda ortadan kaldırmış olacağız.

Evet… Liskov’un Yerine Geçme Prensibinde bu şekilde bir tasarım ve bakış açısı sergilememiz gerekmektedir. 2. sayfada bu prensibi pekiştirmek amacıyla farklı bir örnek senaryo bulacaksınız.

Struct 	(GITHUB) (örnek)
struct nedir

A struct type is a value type that is typically used to encapsulate small groups of related variables, such as the coordinates of a rectangle or the characteristics of an item in an inventory. The following example shows a simple struct declaration:
        struct Book
        {
            public string title;
            public double price;
            public string author;
        }
Structs share most of the same syntax as classes, but are more limited than classes.
Unlike classes, structs can be instantiated without using a new operator.
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Book b;
            b.title = "Test";
            b.price = 5.99;
            b.author = "David";

            Console.WriteLine(b.title);
            //Outputs "Test"
        }
Structs do not support inheritance and cannot contain virtual methods.

Structs can contain methods, properties, indexers, and so on. Structs cannot contain default constructors (a constructor without parameters), but they can have constructors that take parameters. In that case the new keyword is used to instantiate a struct object, similar to class objects.

        struct Point
        {
            public int x;
            public int y;

            public Point(int x, int y)  // Constructor
            {
                this.x = x;
                this.y = y;
            }
        }
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Point p = new Point(10, 15);
            Console.WriteLine(p.x);
            // Outputs 10
        }

Struct vs. Class 	(GITHUB) (örnek)
struct nedir, class nedir, struct vs class

In general, classes are used to model more complex behavior, or data, that is intended to be modified after a class object is created. Structs are best suited for small data structures that contain primarily data that is not intended to be modified after the struct is created. Consider defining a struct instead of a class if you are trying to represent a simple set of data. 

All standard C# types (int, double, bool, char, etc.) are actually structs.

Merhaba,
Programlama dillerinde en mühim OOP(Object Oriented Programing) yapılarından olan class yapısına göre daha basit düzeyde işlemler gerçekleştirmemizi sağlayan ve belirli bir takım kısıtlamaları yanında barındıran struct yapısını C# diline özel ele alacağız.
Şimdi düşünün ki, bir yapı oluşturacaksınız ve bu yapı birbirleriyle ilişkili verileri barındıracaktır. Haliyle bunu bir class olarak belirleyebilir ve o classtan üretilen nesne üzerinde işlemlerimizi icra edebiliriz. Amma velakin bu yapımız class kadar kompleks işlemler için tasarlanmış bir yapı gerektirmiyorsa ve tutulacak verileri enkapsüle etmek yetiyorsa işte bu tarz durumlarda struct yapısını tercih edebiliriz.
Unutmayınız ki, classlar bir Referans Tipli(Reference Types) özellik gösterirken struct yapıları bir Değer Tipli(Value Types) değişken özelliği göstermektedir.
Yani anlayacağınız “int” gibi, “bool” gibi değer tipli bir değişken oluşturmak istiyorsanız struct yapısını tercih edebilirsiniz.
Bu demek oluyor ki, gerçekleştireceğimiz işlevselliğin yapısal olarak bir nesne yahut değer tipli bir değişken yapısında gerçekleştirilmesini tercih edebilir ve birazdan bahsedeceğim olumlu olumsuz yanlarıda hesaba katarak projenizde performansı daha maliyetli bir hale getirebilirsiniz.
Şimdi struct yapısını C# perspektifinden adım adım değerlendirelim;
	Yazımızın yukarıdaki satırlarında da bahsettiğimiz gibi struct C#’ta value type yaratabileceğimiz yapıdır.
	struct yapıları, herhangi bir struct yahut class’tan kalıtım alamazlar.
 		 	
	Benzer şekilde bir class yapısıda struct yapısından miras alamamaktadır.
	struct yapıları, interface yapılarını uygulayabilmektedirler.

	struct yapılar new keywordüyle örneklendirilebilmektedir. Burada iki durum söz konusudur.
1.	Eğer new operatörüyle örneklendirirsek ne olur?
Bildiğiniz gibi new operatörü classlarda kullanıldığı zaman ilgili classtan bir nesne talep edilmekte ve üretilen nesne belleğin Heap kısmında muhafaza edilmektedir. Ee söz gelimi struct yapısında da new operatörünü kullanırsak eğer evet ilgili yapıdan bir nesne üretilecektir ama struct bir değer tipli değişken yapısında olduğundan dolayı o nesne belleğin Stack kısmında muhafaza edilecektir.
Bu yapıya kadar oluşturduğumuz tüm nesnelerin Heap kısmında olduğunu söylemiştik. Halbuki Stack kısmında struct yapısında nesneleri tutabilmekteyiz.
Ayriyetten struct içerisindeki fieldlara default değerleri atanmış olacaktır.

Ekran çıktısı aşağıdadır.
 
2.	Eğer new operatörü kullanmazsak ne olur?

3.	Haliyle classlardaki gibi nesne mecburiyeti yoktur. Yani new operatörü ile struct yapıdan bir nesne üretmeden de o struct’ı kullanabilmekteyiz.
 
Yukarıda da gördüğünüz gibi nesnesiz structları kullanabilmekteyiz kullanmasına ama içerisindeki verilerin ilk değerleri atanmayacağından dolayı hata alınacaktır.
İşte böyle bir durumda ilk değerleri atayarak kullanmak gerekecektir.

Anlayacağınız class yapıları new keywordü ile belleğe fiziksel olarak çıkabilmekte ve kullanılabilmektedir. Aksi taktirde belleğe çıkamamaktadırlar. Struct’larda ise new ile belleğe çıkma zorunluluğu yoktur lakin içerisindeki elemanların ilk değerleri mecburi verilmek zorundadır.

	Haliyle bu elemanlardan metodları kullanabilmek için struct değişkenine new operatörüyle bir nesne bağlama zorunluluğumuz yoktur. Ama property yapılarını kullanabilmek için struct’tan bir nesneye ihtiyacımız vardır.

Evet, gördüğünüz gibi struct dediğimiz aslen yapısal ve içerik(implicit) olarak bir sealed class‘tır diyebiliriz. Bunun yanında daha hafif(lightweight) bir class yapısı olduğu söylenebilir. İçeriğimizden de anlaşılacağına göre Tip Tanımlama(Type Definition) yaparken kullanabiliriz.
İçerikte bahsedildiği gibi referans değil, değer tipli bir yapı göstermesinin sebebini aşağıdaki örnekten de anlayabiliriz.

Burada dikkat ederseniz eğer ms.x ve ms.y değişmeyeceğinden dolayı bir Deep Copy söz konusudur. Eğer referans tipli yapılar olsalardı aşağıdaki gibi bir sonuç elde edilecekti ve Shallow Copy söz konusu olacaktı.
 
Gördüğünüz gibi iki referansta aynı nesneyi işaret ettiğinden dolayı referanslar üzerindeki field değerleri doğal olarak aynı sonucu vermekte yani mc.x ve mc.y değişkenlik göstermektedir.
Son olarak struct yapılarıyla ilgili uç bir noktaya daha değinip içeriğimizi sonlandıralım.
struct yapılar, kendilerini this keywordünü kullanarak değiştirebilen yapılardır.
Örneğin;
 
Aslında bu tarz bir işleme class yapısı izin vermediğinden dolayı ilginç bir özelliktir.
 
Güzel ve eğlenceli bir konununda sonuna gelmiş bulunmaktayız.

In C#, a structure is a value type data type. It helps you to make a single variable hold related data of various data types. The struct keyword is used for creating a structure.
Structures are used to represent a record. Suppose you want to keep track of your books in a library. You might want to track the following attributes about each book −
•	Title
•	Author
•	Subject
•	Book ID
Defining a Structure
To define a structure, you must use the struct statement. The struct statement defines a new data type, with more than one member for your program.
For example, here is the way you can declare the Book structure −
struct Books {
   public string title;
   public string author;
   public string subject;
   public int book_id;
};  
The following program shows the use of the structure −
Live Demo
using System;

struct Books {
   public string title;
   public string author;
   public string subject;
   public int book_id;
};  

public class testStructure {
   public static void Main(string[] args) {
      Books Book1;   /* Declare Book1 of type Book */
      Books Book2;   /* Declare Book2 of type Book */

      /* book 1 specification */
      Book1.title = "C Programming";
      Book1.author = "Nuha Ali"; 
      Book1.subject = "C Programming Tutorial";
      Book1.book_id = 6495407;

      /* book 2 specification */
      Book2.title = "Telecom Billing";
      Book2.author = "Zara Ali";
      Book2.subject =  "Telecom Billing Tutorial";
      Book2.book_id = 6495700;

      /* print Book1 info */
      Console.WriteLine( "Book 1 title : {0}", Book1.title);
      Console.WriteLine("Book 1 author : {0}", Book1.author);
      Console.WriteLine("Book 1 subject : {0}", Book1.subject);
      Console.WriteLine("Book 1 book_id :{0}", Book1.book_id);

      /* print Book2 info */
      Console.WriteLine("Book 2 title : {0}", Book2.title);
      Console.WriteLine("Book 2 author : {0}", Book2.author);
      Console.WriteLine("Book 2 subject : {0}", Book2.subject);
      Console.WriteLine("Book 2 book_id : {0}", Book2.book_id);       

      Console.ReadKey();
   }
}
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −
Book 1 title : C Programming
Book 1 author : Nuha Ali
Book 1 subject : C Programming Tutorial
Book 1 book_id : 6495407
Book 2 title : Telecom Billing
Book 2 author : Zara Ali
Book 2 subject : Telecom Billing Tutorial
Book 2 book_id : 6495700
Features of C# Structures
You have already used a simple structure named Books. Structures in C# are quite different from that in traditional C or C++. The C# structures have the following features −
•	Structures can have methods, fields, indexers, properties, operator methods, and events.
•	Structures can have defined constructors, but not destructors. However, you cannot define a default constructor for a structure. The default constructor is automatically defined and cannot be changed.
•	Unlike classes, structures cannot inherit other structures or classes.
•	Structures cannot be used as a base for other structures or classes.
•	A structure can implement one or more interfaces.
•	Structure members cannot be specified as abstract, virtual, or protected.
•	When you create a struct object using the New operator, it gets created and the appropriate constructor is called. Unlike classes, structs can be instantiated without using the New operator.
•	If the New operator is not used, the fields remain unassigned and the object cannot be used until all the fields are initialized.

Class versus Structure
Classes and Structures have the following basic differences −
•	classes are reference types and structs are value types
•	structures do not support inheritance
•	structures cannot have default constructor
In the light of the above discussions, let us rewrite the previous example −
Live Demo
using System;

struct Books {
   private string title;
   private string author;
   private string subject;
   private int book_id;
   
   public void getValues(string t, string a, string s, int id) {
      title = t;
      author = a;
      subject = s;
      book_id = id;
   }
   
   public void display() {
      Console.WriteLine("Title : {0}", title);
      Console.WriteLine("Author : {0}", author);
      Console.WriteLine("Subject : {0}", subject);
      Console.WriteLine("Book_id :{0}", book_id);
   }
};  

public class testStructure {

   public static void Main(string[] args) {
      Books Book1 = new Books();   /* Declare Book1 of type Book */
      Books Book2 = new Books();   /* Declare Book2 of type Book */

      /* book 1 specification */
      Book1.getValues("C Programming",
      "Nuha Ali", "C Programming Tutorial",6495407);

      /* book 2 specification */
      Book2.getValues("Telecom Billing",
      "Zara Ali", "Telecom Billing Tutorial", 6495700);

      /* print Book1 info */
      Book1.display();

      /* print Book2 info */
      Book2.display(); 

      Console.ReadKey();
   }
}
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −
Title : C Programming
Author : Nuha Ali
Subject : C Programming Tutorial
Book_id : 6495407
Title : Telecom Billing
Author : Zara Ali
Subject : Telecom Billing Tutorial
Book_id : 6495700

C# - Struct
________________________________________
Updated on: June 25, 2020
________________________________________
In C#, struct is the value type data type that represents data structures. It can contain a parameterized constructor, static constructor, constants, fields, methods, properties, indexers, operators, events, and nested types.
struct can be used to hold small data values that do not require inheritance, e.g. coordinate points, key-value pairs, and complex data structure.
Structure Declaration
A structure is declared using struct keyword. The default modifier is internal for the struct and its members.
The following example declares a structure Coordinate for the graph.
Example: Structure
struct Coordinate
{
    public int x;
    public int y;
}
A struct object can be created with or without the new operator, same as primitive type variables.
Example: Create Structure
struct Coordinate
{
    public int x;
    public int y;
}

Coordinate point = new Coordinate();
Console.WriteLine(point.x); //output: 0  
Console.WriteLine(point.y); //output: 0  
Try it
Above, an object of the Coordinate structure is created using the new keyword. It calls the default parameterless constructor of the struct, which initializes all the members to their default value of the specified data type.
If you declare a variable of struct type without using new keyword, it does not call any constructor, so all the members remain unassigned. Therefore, you must assign values to each member before accessing them, otherwise, it will give a compile-time error.
Example: Create Structure Without new Keyword
struct Coordinate
{
    public int x;
    public int y;
}

Coordinate point;
Console.Write(point.x); // Compile time error  

point.x = 10;
point.y = 20;
Console.Write(point.x); //output: 10  
Console.Write(point.y); //output: 20  

Constructors in Structure
A struct cannot contain a parameterless constructor. It can only contain parameterized constructors or a static constructor.
Example: Parameterized Constructor in Struct
struct Coordinate
{
    public int x;
    public int y;

    public Coordinate(int x, int y)
    {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
}

Coordinate point = new Coordinate(10, 20);

Console.WriteLine(point.x); //output: 10  
Console.WriteLine(point.y); //output: 20  
Try it
You must include all the members of the struct in the parameterized constructor and assign parameters to members; otherwise C# compiler will give a compile-time error if any member remains unassigned.
Methods and Properties in Structure
A struct can contain properties, auto-implemented properties, methods, etc., same as classes.
Example: Methods and Properties in Struct
struct Coordinate
{
    public int x { get; set; }
    public int y { get; set; }

    public void SetOrigin()
    {
        this.x = 0;
        this.y = 0;
    }
}

Coordinate point = Coordinate();
point.SetOrigin();

Console.WriteLine(point.x); //output: 0  
Console.WriteLine(point.y); //output: 0  
Try it
The following struct includes the static method.
Example: Static Constructor in Struct
struct Coordinate
{
    public int x;
    public int y;

    public Coordinate(int x, int y)
    {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    public static Coordinate GetOrigin()
    {
        return new Coordinate();
    }
}

Coordinate point = Coordinate.GetOrigin();

Console.WriteLine(point.x); //output: 0  
Console.WriteLine(point.y); //output: 0  
Try it
Events in Structure
A struct can contain events to notify subscribers about some action. The following struct contains an event.
Example: Event in Structure
struct Coordinate
{
    private int _x, _y;

    public int x 
    {
        get{
            return _x;
        }

        set{
            _x = value;
            CoordinatesChanged(_x);
        }
    }

    public int y
    {
        get{
            return _y;
        }

        set{
            _y = value;
            CoordinatesChanged(_y);
        }
    }

    public event Action<int> CoordinatesChanged;
}
The above structure contains CoordinatesChanged event, which will be raised when x or y coordinate changes. The following example demonstrates the handling of the CoordinatesChanged event.
Example: Handle Structure Events
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {

        Coordinate point = new Coordinate();
        
        point.CoordinatesChanged += StructEventHandler;
        point.x = 10;
        point.y = 20;
    }

    static void StructEventHandler(int point)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Coordinate changed to {0}", point);
    }
} 
struct is a value type, so it is faster than a class object. Use struct whenever you want to just store the data. Generally, structs are good for game programming. However, it is easier to transfer a class object than a struct. So do not use struct when you are passing data across the wire or to other classes.
Summary
•	struct can include constructors, constants, fields, methods, properties, indexers, operators, events & nested types.
•	struct cannot include a parameterless constructor or a destructor.
•	struct can implement interfaces, same as class.
•	struct cannot inherit another structure or class, and it cannot be the base of a class.
•	struct members cannot be specified as abstract, sealed, virtual, or protected

Enumeration	(GITHUB) (örnek)
enumeration nedir

An enumeration is a complete, ordered listing of all the items in a collection. The term is commonly used in mathematics and computer science to refer to a listing of all of the elements of a set. The precise requirements for an enumeration (for example, whether the set must be finite, or whether the list is allowed to contain repetitions) depend on the discipline of study and the context of a given problem.
Some sets can be enumerated by means of a natural ordering (such as 1, 2, 3, 4, ... for the set of positive integers), but in other cases it may be necessary to impose a (perhaps arbitrary) ordering. In some contexts, such as enumerative combinatorics, the term enumeration is used more in the sense of counting – with emphasis on determination of the number of elements that a set contains, rather than the production of an explicit listing of those elements.

Enum 	(GITHUB) (örnek)
enum nedir, enum keyword nedir
The enum keyword is used to declare an enumeration: a type that consists of a set of named constants called the enumerator list.
By default, the first enumerator has the value 0, and the value of each successive enumerator is increased by 1.
For example, in the following enumeration, Sun is 0, Mon is 1, Tue is 2, and so on:

        enum Days { Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat };

You can also assign your own enumerator values:

        enum Days { Sun, Mon, Tue = 4, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat };

In the example above, the enumeration will start from 0.
Sun is 0, then Mon is 1, Tue is 4, Wed is 5, and so on. The value of the next item in an Enum is one increment of the previous value.
Note that the values are comma separated.
You can refer to the values in the Enum with the dot syntax.
In order to assign Enum values to int variables, you have to specify the type in parentheses:

        enum Days { Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat };

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int x = (int)Days.Sat;
            Console.WriteLine(x);
            Console.ReadKey();
            //Outputs 6
        }
Basically, Enums define variables that represent members of a fixed set.
Some sample Enum uses include month names, days of the week, cards in a deck, etc.

interface vs. abstract class (GITHUB) (örnek)
enum nedir, enum keyword nedir

https://medium.com/software-development-turkey/abstract-class-ve-interface-aras%C4%B1ndaki-farklar-nelerdir-3c0a4f956eba
Total encapsulation sunar, bunu sağlamak isteyen programmer'lar interface kullanmalıdır. Multiple inheritance kullanma amacındaysak bu işi interface ile yapabiliriz. Tüm metotların sadece ne yaptığı belli, nasıl yaptığı belirsizdir çünkü interface içindeki memberlar sadece signature'a sahip olan metotlara sahiplerdir. İçi dolu olan, yani işlemi "nasıl" yaptığı belli olan bir metot barındırmaz. Dolayısıyla tam bir encapsulation sağlar.
Interface'in avantajları: 

•  It is used to achieve loose coupling.
•  It is used to achieve total abstraction.
•  To achieve component-based programming
•  To achieve multiple inheritance and abstraction.
•  Interfaces add a plug and play like architecture into applications.

  Points to Remember :
1.	An interface only contains declarations of method, properties, indexers, and events.
2.	An interface can be implement implicitly or explicitly by a class or struct.
3.	A class or struct which implements an interface, must use 'public' access modifier.
4.	An interface cannot include private, protected, or internal members. All the members are public by default.
5.	Do not include 'public' in an interface as all the members are public by default. C# will give compile-time error if used 'public'.
6.	Implement interface explicitly using InterfaceName. with all the members.
7.	An interface can inherit one or more interfaces.

An interface is like a contract. In the human world, the contract between the two or more humans binds them to act as per the contract. In the same way, the interface includes the declaration of one or more functionalities. Entities that implement the interface must define functionalities declared in the interface. In C#, a class or a struct can implement one or more interfaces.
In C#, an interface can be defined using the interface keyword. Interfaces can contain methods, properties, indexers, and events as members.
Consider the following IPen interface that declares some basic functionality for a pen.
Example: An Interface
interface IPen
{
    string Color { get; set; }
    bool Open();
    bool Close();
    void Write(string text);
}
Example: Invalid Interface with Access Modifiers
interface IPen
{
    public string Color { get; set; }  //error
    protected bool Open(); //error
    private bool Close();  //error
    protected internal void Write(string text);//error
}
An interface can only contain declarations but not implementations. The following will give a compile-time error.
Example: Invalid Interface with Implementation
interface IPen
{
    string Color { get; set; }
    bool Open();
    bool Close();
    void Write(string text){
        Console.Write(text);  //error: cannot implement method
    }
}
Implementing an Interface
For example, the following class implements IPen interface implicitly.
Example: Interface Implementation
class Cello : IPen
{
    public string Color { get; set; }
        
    private bool isOpen = false;
        
    public bool Close()
    {
        isOpen = false;
        Console.WriteLine("Cello closed for writing!");

        return isOpen;
    }

    public bool Open()
    {
        isOpen = true;
        Console.WriteLine("Cello open for writing!");
            
        return isOpen;
    }

    public void Write(string text)
    {
        //write text if open
        if(isOpen)
            Console.WriteLine("Cello: " + text);
    }
}
In the above example, the Cello class implements the IPen interface. It defines all the members of the IPen interface with public access modifier. However, other non-interface members of the class can have any access modifiers e.g. isOpen field is a private member of the Cello class.
 Note:
All the members of the interface must be implemented with the public modifier in a class or struct. C# will give a compile-time error if any one of the members declared other than public access modifier.
Explicit Interface Implementation
Explicit implementation is useful when class is implementing multiple interface thereby it is more readable and eliminates the confusion. It is also useful if interfaces have same method name coincidently.
 Note:
Do not use public modifier with an explicit implementation. It will give compile time error.
You can implement interface explicitly by prefixing interface name with all the members of an interface, as shown below:
Example: Explicit Implementation
class Cello : IPen
{
    string IPen.Color { get; set; }
        
    private bool isOpen = false;
        
    bool IPen.Close()
    {
        isOpen = false;
        Console.WriteLine("Cello closed for writing!");

        return isOpen;
    }

    bool IPen.Open()
    {
        isOpen = true;
        Console.WriteLine("Cello open for writing!");
            
        return isOpen;
    }

    void IPen.Write(string text)
    {
        //write text if open
        if(isOpen)
            Console.WriteLine("Cello: " + text);
    }
} 
In the above example of explicit implementation, notice that it cannot use access modifier 'public' explicitly. C# will give an error if you use 'public' modifier when implementing interface explicitly.

There can be multiple classes or structs that implements the same interface. Consider the following example.
class Parker : IPen
{
    public string Color { get; set; }
        
    private bool canWrite = false;
        
    public bool Close()
    {
        canWrite = false;
        Console.WriteLine("Parker is closed now!");

        return canWrite;
    }

    public bool Open()
    {
        canWrite = true;
        Console.WriteLine("Parker is open now!");
            
        return canWrite;
    }

    public void Write(string text)
    {
        //write text if open
        if(canWrite)
            Console.WriteLine("Parker: " + text);
    }
}
As you can see, the Parker class implements the IPen class. It implements the same functionalities declared in IPen class but in a different way than Cello class. (prints different messages in Open(), Close() and Write() methods.) Thus, multiple classes or Structs can implement the same interface which performs the same action but differently.
You can now create objects of the class and assigned to a variable of interface type.
Example: Interface Type Variable
IPen pen1 = new Cello();

IPen pen2 = new Parker();
Try it
The same variable can be used to instantiate all the classes which implemented IPen interface.
IPen mypen = new Cello();
mypen = new Parker(); // assign Parker object to same variable
Implement Multiple Interfaces
A class or struct can implement multiple interfaces and must define all the members of all interfaces.
Example: Implement Multiple Interface
interface IBrandedPen
{
    string GetBrandName();
}

class Parker : IPen, IBrandedPen
{
    //Implement all members of IPen and IBrandedPen
}
Now, the Parker class can be instantiated and assigned to either IPen or IBrandedPen interface, as shown below.
Example: Interface Type Variables
IPen pen1 = new Parker();
pen1.Open();// valid 
pen1.GetBrandName(); //Compile-time error. Cannot call IBrandedPen method on the object of type IPen

IBrandedPen pen2 = new Parker();
pen2.GetBrandName();// valid 
pen2.Open();//Compile-time error. Cannot call IPen method on the object of type IBrandedPen
Try it
As you can see, an object only supports methods of an interface to which it assigned to, e.g. pen1 assigned to IPen so only supports methods of IPen and not of IBrandedPen.
An interface can also inherit one or more interface.
Example: Interface Inheritance
interface IPen
{
    string Color { get; set; }
    bool Open();
    bool Close();
    void Write(string text);
}

interface IBrandedPen : IPen 
{
    string GetBrandName();
}

class Parker : IBrandedPen
{
    //Implement all members of IPen and IBrandedPen
}

Html Helper 	(GITHUB) (örnek)
html helper nedir

HtmlHelper class generates html elements. For example, 
@Html.ActionLink("Create New", "Create") 
would generate anchor tag:
 <a href="/Student/Create">Create New</a>.
Visual Studio also provides minimum IntelliSense support when writing HTML Helpers, as the parameters for the HTML Helper methods are all strings. For example, in the following code, the LabelFor and TextBoxFor HTML Helper methods are used to create a label and textbox for a model property:
Copy
<div class="form-group"> 
    @Html.LabelFor(m => m.Email, new { @class = "col-md-2 control-label" }) 
    <div class="col-md-10"> 
        @Html.TextBoxFor(m => m.Email, new { @class = "form-control" }) 
    </div> 
</div> 
Because the class is a reserved word in C#, you will notice in the preceding code how you have to append the @ sign in order to...
The difference between HTML Helpers and Tag Helpers
Tag Helpers are attached to HTML elements inside your Razor views and can help you write markup that is both cleaner and easier to read than the traditional HTML Helpers. HTML Helpers, on the other hand, are invoked as methods that are mixed with HTML inside your Razor views.

Razor 	(GITHUB) (örnek)
razor nedir, razor view nedir
Razor bir markup syntax'ıdır. MVC'nin view tarafında kullanılır.
Razor is a markup syntax that lets you embed server-based code into web pages using C# and cshtml is the extension of razor file Cshtml = cs (C#) + HTML. Components are typically implemented in Razor Component files (.razor) using a combination of C# and HTML markup (.cshtml files are used in Blazor apps).

Reference Type, Value Type  	(GITHUB) (örnek)
Reference type nedir, Value type nedir,

Reference Data Types : The Reference Data Types will contain a memory address of variable value because the reference types won’t store the variable value directly in memory. The built-in reference types are string, object.

Value Data Types : In C#, the Value Data Types will directly store the variable value in memory and it will also accept both signed and unsigned literals. The derived class for these data types are System.ValueType. Following are different Value Data Types in C# programming language:…
Value Type VALUE TUTAR. Adı üstünde… Başka da bişey tutmaz. Yani sadece Value alacak… 0,1,2,3 gibi…
Reference Type da reference tutar. Adı üstünde. Yani referansını tutar…
Initialize etmediğimiz bir int değeri olsun;
Int newInt;
Bu obje'nin bu haldeki değeri 0 olur.Null olmaz. Çünkü int'ler value type'dır ve value'den başka bir şey tutamaz. (Int, yukarıdaki haliyle null olamaz, bir int değeri null olabilmesi için int? şeklinde declare edilmelidir)
String asdf;
Bu ise Reference Type olduğu için null değere işaret eder. Yani değeri NULL olur. Çünkü String'ler Reference Type'dır. Bir değeri yoktur. Değeri olmayan bir verinin ADRESİNİ TUTAR. Adresini tuttuğu şeyin değeri yoktur şu anda (String asdf;). Bu yüzden bu string'in şu anki değeri NULL olur.

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers. 
HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server. 
A web browser may be the client, and an application on a computer that hosts a web site may be the server. 
Example: A client (browser) submits an HTTP request to the server; then the server returns a response to the client. The response contains status information about the request and may also contain the requested content.

Tag Helper	(GITHUB) (örnek)
Tag Helper nedir, taghelper nedir
Detay: https://docs.microsoft.com/tr-tr/aspnet/core/mvc/views/tag-helpers/intro?view=aspnetcore-3.0
Tag Helpers enable server-side code to participate in creating and rendering HTML elements in Razor files. Tag helpers are a new feature and similar to HTML helpers, which help us render HTML.

örnek:
Rendering Links
The easiest way to render an HTML link in a view is to use the HTML.ActionLink() helper. The Html.ActionLink() does not link to a view. Instead, you use the Html.ActionLink() helper to create a link to a controller action.
For example, the view in Listing 1 includes a link to an action named About (see Figure 1).
Figure 1 – Link rendered by Html.ActionLink() helper
 

Tag Helpers enable server-side code to participate in creating and rendering HTML elements in Razor files. For example, the built-in ImageTagHelper can append a version number to the image name. Whenever the image changes, the server generates a new unique version for the image, so clients are guaranteed to get the current image (instead of a stale cached image). There are many built-in Tag Helpers for common tasks - such as creating forms, links, loading assets and more - and even more available in public GitHub repositories and as NuGet packages. Tag Helpers are authored in C#, and they target HTML elements based on element name, attribute name, or parent tag. For example, the built-in LabelTagHelper can target the HTML <label> element when the LabelTagHelper attributes are applied. If you're familiar with HTML Helpers, Tag Helpers reduce the explicit transitions between HTML and C# in Razor views. In many cases, HTML Helpers provide an alternative approach to a specific Tag Helper, but it's important to recognize that Tag Helpers don't replace HTML Helpers and there's not a Tag Helper for each HTML Helper. Tag Helpers compared to HTML Helpers explains the differences in more detail.
public class Movie
{
    public int ID { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public DateTime ReleaseDate { get; set; }
    public string Genre { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}
The following Razor markup:
<label asp-for="Movie.Title"></label>
Generates the following HTML:
<label for="Movie_Title">Title</label>

Tag Helper nedir ve yararları nelerdir?
Tag helper server-side kodlarımızı html tagleri gibi oluşturup kullanmamızı sağlar. Tag Helper HTML ve C# arasındaki geçişleri azaltır.(Yani Razor görünümü azalır-@ kullanımı azalmış olur.) Bu da bizlere Viewmizin daha okunabilir, anlaşılabilir ve kolay geliştirilebilir hale getirmesini sağlamaktadır.

Örneğin;

  @Html.ActionLink("Go to index","Index","Home")
  <a asp-action="index" asp-controller="home" >Go to index</a>

HTML taglerimide asp- dediğimizde o tagin Tag Helperları kullanabiliriz. VS bizlere IntelliSense desteğini de sağlamaktadır.
Tag Helperları kullanmak istiyorsak 
View/_ViewImports.cshtml üzerinden yapıyoruz.

What are Tag Helpers
Tag Helpers enable server-side code to participate in creating and rendering HTML elements in Razor files. For example, the built-in ImageTagHelper can append a version number to the image name. Whenever the image changes, the server generates a new unique version for the image, so clients are guaranteed to get the current image (instead of a stale cached image). There are many built-in Tag Helpers for common tasks - such as creating forms, links, loading assets and more - and even more available in public GitHub repositories and as NuGet packages.

For example, the built-in LabelTagHelper can target the HTML <label> element when the LabelTagHelper attributes are applied. If you're familiar with HTML Helpers, Tag Helpers reduce the explicit transitions between HTML and C# in Razor views. In many cases, HTML Helpers provide an alternative approach to a specific Tag Helper, but it's important to recognize that Tag Helpers don't replace HTML Helpers and there's not a Tag Helper for each HTML Helper. Tag Helpers compared to HTML Helpers explains the differences in more detail.
What Tag Helpers provide
An HTML-friendly development experience For the most part, Razor markup using Tag Helpers looks like standard HTML. Front-end designers conversant with HTML/CSS/JavaScript can edit Razor without learning C# Razor syntax.
A rich IntelliSense environment for creating HTML and Razor markup This is in sharp contrast to HTML Helpers, the previous approach to server-side creation of markup in Razor views. Tag Helpers compared to HTML Helpers explains the differences in more detail. IntelliSense support for Tag Helpers explains the IntelliSense environment. Even developers experienced with Razor C# syntax are more productive using Tag Helpers than writing C# Razor markup.
A way to make you more productive and able to produce more robust, reliable, and maintainable code using information only available on the server For example, historically the mantra on updating images was to change the name of the image when you change the image. Images should be aggressively cached for performance reasons, and unless you change the name of an image, you risk clients getting a stale copy. Historically, after an image was edited, the name had to be changed and each reference to the image in the web app needed to be updated. Not only is this very labor intensive, it's also error prone (you could miss a reference, accidentally enter the wrong string, etc.) The built-in ImageTagHelper can do this for you automatically. The ImageTagHelper can append a version number to the image name, so whenever the image changes, the server automatically generates a new unique version for the image. Clients are guaranteed to get the current image. This robustness and labor savings comes essentially free by using the ImageTagHelper.
Most built-in Tag Helpers target standard HTML elements and provide server-side attributes for the element. For example, the <input> element used in many views in the Views/Account folder contains the asp-for attribute. This attribute extracts the name of the specified model property into the rendered HTML. Consider a Razor view with the following model:
public class Movie
{
    public int ID { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public DateTime ReleaseDate { get; set; }
    public string Genre { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}
The following Razor markup:
<label asp-for="Movie.Title"></label>
Generates the following HTML:
<label for="Movie_Title">Title</label>
The asp-for attribute is made available by the For property in the LabelTagHelper. See Author Tag Helpers for more information.
Managing Tag Helper scope

Tag Helpers scope is controlled by a combination of @addTagHelper, @removeTagHelper, and the "!" opt-out character.
Opting out of individual elements

You can disable a Tag Helper at the element level with the Tag Helper opt-out character ("!"). For example, Email validation is disabled in the <span> with the Tag Helper opt-out character:
<!span asp-validation-for="Email" class="text-danger"></!span>
You must apply the Tag Helper opt-out character to the opening and closing tag. (The Visual Studio editor automatically adds the opt-out character to the closing tag when you add one to the opening tag). After you add the opt-out character, the element and Tag Helper attributes are no longer displayed in a distinctive font.
Self-closing Tag Helpers
Many Tag Helpers can't be used as self-closing tags. Some Tag Helpers are designed to be self-closing tags. Using a Tag Helper that was not designed to be self-closing suppresses the rendered output. Self-closing a Tag Helper results in a self-closing tag in the rendered output. For more information, see this note in Authoring Tag Helpers.
C# in Tag Helpers attribute/declaration
Tag Helpers do not allow C# in the element's attribute or tag declaration area. For example, the following code is not valid:
<input asp-for="LastName" 
@(Model?.LicenseId == null ? "disabled" : string.Empty) />
The preceding code can be written as:
<input asp-for="LastName" disabled="@(Model?.LicenseId == null)" />
IntelliSense support for Tag Helpers
When you create a new ASP.NET Core web app in Visual Studio, it adds the NuGet package "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Razor.Tools". This is the package that adds Tag Helper tooling.
Consider writing an HTML <label> element. As soon as you enter <l in the Visual Studio editor, IntelliSense displays matching elements:
 
Not only do you get HTML help, but the icon (the "@" symbol with "<>" under it).
 
identifies the element as targeted by Tag Helpers. Pure HTML elements (such as the fieldset) display the "<>" icon.
A pure HTML <label> tag displays the HTML tag (with the default Visual Studio color theme) in a brown font, the attributes in red, and the attribute values in blue.
 
After you enter <label, IntelliSense lists the available HTML/CSS attributes and the Tag Helper-targeted attributes:
 
IntelliSense statement completion allows you to enter the tab key to complete the statement with the selected value:
 
As soon as a Tag Helper attribute is entered, the tag and attribute fonts change. Using the default Visual Studio "Blue" or "Light" color theme, the font is bold purple. If you're using the "Dark" theme the font is bold teal. The images in this document were taken using the default theme.
 
You can enter the Visual Studio CompleteWord shortcut (Ctrl +spacebar is the default inside the double quotes (""), and you are now in C#, just like you would be in a C# class. IntelliSense displays all the methods and properties on the page model. The methods and properties are available because the property type is ModelExpression. In the image below, I'm editing the Register view, so the RegisterViewModel is available.
 
IntelliSense lists the properties and methods available to the model on the page. The rich IntelliSense environment helps you select the CSS class:

StringBuilder	(GITHUB) (örnek)
StringBuilder nedir
Detay:
The String object is immutable. Every time you use one of the methods in the System.String class, you create a new string object in memory, which requires a new allocation of space for that new object. In situations where you need to perform repeated modifications to a string, the overhead associated with creating a new String object can be costly. The System.Text.StringBuilder class can be used when you want to modify a string without creating a new object. For example, using the StringBuilder class can boost performance when concatenating many strings together in a loop.
-
-
Mutable and Immutable (GITHUB)  (örnek)
mutable nedir, immutable nedir
In English Language Mutable means "can change" and immutable means "cannot change". The term Immutable Object means that the state of the Object cannot change after its creation. An immutable type sets the property or state of the object as read only because it cannot be modified after it is assigned during initialization.
Is String in .Net immutable ?
Yes, the String in .Net is immutable. The System.String class is an immutable type provided in the .NET framework class library. Since a String is an immutable type, it cannot be modified. When you modify a string you are actually creating a new string object with the desired value.
e.g.
 
The above code will create 1000 new string variables in the memory.

-
DataSet (GITHUB)  (örnek)
dataset nedir
DataSet. This is a collection of DataTables. We use the DataSet type to store many DataTables in a single collection. Conceptually, the DataSet acts as a set of DataTable instances.
Usage. DataSet simplifies programs that use many DataTables. To effectively use the DataSet, you will need to have some DataTables handy. We begin by creating some.
Create. In this program, we create two DataTables. One stores two rows of patient information. And the second stores two rows of medication information.
Next: We create a DataSet with the DataSet constructor. Then we add the two DataTables to the DataSet instance. Finally we print the XML.


public ActionResult Index()
        {
            // Çalıştırabilmek için Controller adını "Home" olarak değiştirmek gerekebilir (gerekmeyedebilir).

            // Sonra oluşturulan tabloya kolonlar eklendi
            // Sonra bu kolonlara örnek veriler eklendi (datarow)
            // Sonra ilk başta oluşturduğumuz Dataset'in içine, DataTable'ımızı yerleştirdik ve View'a yolladık.

Dapper, ADO.NET - EF hız karşılaştırma
There's no doubt that Entity Framework with LINQ is great (I've certainly written enough articles about it). But Entity Framework comes at a cost. As Matthew Jones points out on his blog, using LINQ+Entity Framework adds time to each data retrieval compared to using ADO.NET's SqlDataAdapter. The cost is small (anywhere from a third of a millisecond to 100 milliseconds) but it's not zero, either.
If speed is important to you but you don't want to give up object-oriented data access, then you can consider using Dapper. Like Entity Framework, Dapper is an Object Relation Mapper that allows you to issue queries against a relational database and get back objects. What's attractive about Dapper, compared to Entity Framework, is that its response times are equivalent to using pure ADO.NET.

Base keyword      (GITHUB)  (örnek)
Base nedir, base keyword nedir
The base keyword is used to access members of the base class from within a derived class:
•	Call a method on the base class that has been overridden by another method.
•	Specify which base-class constructor should be called when creating instances of the derived class.
A base class access is permitted only in a constructor, an instance method, or an instance property accessor.
It is an error to use the base keyword from within a static method.
The base class that is accessed is the base class specified in the class declaration. For example, if you specify class ClassB : ClassA, the members of ClassA are accessed from ClassB, regardless of the base class of ClassA.

abstract	    (GITHUB)  (örnek)
abstract nedir
The abstract modifier indicates that the thing being modified has a missing or incomplete implementation. The abstract modifier can be used with classes, methods, properties, indexers, and events. Use the abstract modifier in a class declaration to indicate that a class is intended only to be a base class of other classes, not instantiated on its own. Members marked as abstract must be implemented by non-abstract classes that derive from the abstract class.
Example
In this example, the class Square must provide an implementation of GetArea because it derives from Shape:
C#Copy
abstract class Shape
{
    public abstract int GetArea();
}

class Square : Shape
{
    int side;

    public Square(int n) => side = n;

    // GetArea method is required to avoid a compile-time error.
    public override int GetArea() => side * side;

    static void Main()
    {
        var sq = new Square(12);
        Console.WriteLine($"Area of the square = {sq.GetArea()}");
    }
}
// Output: Area of the square = 144
Abstract classes have the following features:
•	An abstract class cannot be instantiated.
•	An abstract class may contain abstract methods and accessors.
•	It is not possible to modify an abstract class with the sealed modifier because the two modifiers have opposite meanings. The sealed modifier prevents a class from being inherited and the abstract modifier requires a class to be inherited.

Abstract data type 	(GITHUB) (örnek)
Abstract data type nedir
Abstract Data type (ADT) is a type (or class) for objects whose behaviour is defined by a set of value and a set of operations.
The definition of ADT only mentions what operations are to be performed but not how these operations will be implemented. It does not specify how data will be organized in memory and what algorithms will be used for implementing the operations. It is called “abstract” because it gives an implementation-independent view. The process of providing only the essentials and hiding the details is known as abstraction.
 
The user of data type does not need to know how that data type is implemented, for example, we have been using Primitive values like int, float, char data types only with the knowledge that these data type can operate and be performed on without any idea of how they are implemented. So a user only needs to know what a data type can do, but not how it will be implemented. Think of ADT as a black box which hides the inner structure and design of the data type. Now we’ll define three ADTs namely List ADT, Stack ADT, Queue ADT.
1.	List ADT
•	The data is generally stored in key sequence in a list which has a head structure consisting of count, pointers and address of compare function needed to compare the data in the list.
 


•	The data node contains the pointer to a data structure and a self-referential pointer which points to the next node in the list.
filter_none
brightness_4
//List ADT Type Definitions 
typedef struct node 
{ 
 void *DataPtr; 
 struct node *link; 
} Node; 
typedef struct
{ 
 int count; 
 Node *pos; 
 Node *head; 
 Node *rear; 
 int (*compare) (void *argument1, void *argument2) 
} LIST;  
•	The List ADT Functions is given below:
 
A list contains elements of the same type arranged in sequential order and following operations can be performed on the list.
•	get() – Return an element from the list at any given position.
•	insert() – Insert an element at any position of the list.
•	remove() – Remove the first occurrence of any element from a non-empty list.
•	removeAt() – Remove the element at a specified location from a non-empty list.
•	replace() – Replace an element at any position by another element.
•	size() – Return the number of elements in the list.
•	isEmpty() – Return true if the list is empty, otherwise return false.
•	isFull() – Return true if the list is full, otherwise return false.
2.	Stack ADT
•	In Stack ADT Implementation instead of data being stored in each node, the pointer to data is stored.
•	The program allocates memory for the data and address is passed to the stack ADT.
 
•	The head node and the data nodes are encapsulated in the ADT. The calling function can only see the pointer to the stack.
•	The stack head structure also contains a pointer to top and count of number of entries currently in stack.

filter_none
brightness_4
//Stack ADT Type Definitions 
typedef struct node 
{ 
 void *DataPtr; 
 struct node *link; 
} StackNode; 
typedef struct
{ 
 int count; 
 StackNode *top; 
} STACK; 
A Stack contains elements of the same type arranged in sequential order. All operations take place at a single end that is top of the stack and following operations can be performed:
•	push() – Insert an element at one end of the stack called top.
•	pop() – Remove and return the element at the top of the stack, if it is not empty.
•	peek() – Return the element at the top of the stack without removing it, if the stack is not empty.
•	size() – Return the number of elements in the stack.
•	isEmpty() – Return true if the stack is empty, otherwise return false.
•	isFull() – Return true if the stack is full, otherwise return false.
3.	Queue ADT
•	The queue abstract data type (ADT) follows the basic design of the stack abstract data type.
 
•	Each node contains a void pointer to the data and the link pointer to the next element in the queue. The program’s responsibility is to allocate memory for storing the data.


//Queue ADT Type Definitions 
typedef struct node 
{ 
 void *DataPtr; 
 struct node *next; 
} QueueNode; 
typedef struct 
{ 
 QueueNode *front; 
 QueueNode *rear; 
 int count; 
} QUEUE; 
A Queue contains elements of the same type arranged in sequential order. Operations take place at both ends, insertion is done at the end and deletion is done at the front. Following operations can be performed:
•	enqueue() – Insert an element at the end of the queue.
•	dequeue() – Remove and return the first element of the queue, if the queue is not empty.
•	peek() – Return the element of the queue without removing it, if the queue is not empty.
•	size() – Return the number of elements in the queue.
•	isEmpty() – Return true if the queue is empty, otherwise return false.
•	isFull() – Return true if the queue is full, otherwise return false.
From these definitions, we can clearly see that the definitions do not specify how these ADTs will be represented and how the operations will be carried out. There can be different ways to implement an ADT, for example, the List ADT can be implemented using arrays, or singly linked list or doubly linked list. Similarly, stack ADT and Queue ADT can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.

Microsoft Exchange Server  (GITHUB) (örnek)
Microsoft Exchange Server nedir
Microsoft Exchange Server, Microsoft tarafından üretilen bir haberleşme yazılımıdır. Sunucu ürünlerinden Microsoft Servers'ın bir parçası olup Microsoft altyapısına sahip sistemlerde sıkça kullanılmaktadır. Exchange'in öne çıkan özellikleri e-posta, takvim, kişiler ve işler, bilgiye web tabanlı erişim olanağı ve veri depolama desteğidir.
Microsoft Exchange Server is a mail server and calendaring server developed by Microsoft. It runs exclusively on Windows Server operating systems.
The first version was called Exchange Server 4.0, to position it as the successor to the related Microsoft Mail 3.5. Exchange initially used the X.400 directory service but switched to Active Directory later. Until version 5.0 it came bundled with an email client called Microsoft Exchange Client. This was discontinued in favor of Microsoft Outlook.
Exchange Server primarily uses a proprietary protocol called MAPI to talk to email clients, but subsequently added support for POP3, IMAP, and EAS. The standard SMTP protocol is used to communicate to other Internet mail servers.
Exchange Server is licensed both as on-premises software and software as a service (SaaS). In the on-premises form, customers purchase client access licenses (CALs); as SaaS, Microsoft charges a monthly service fee instead.

Single Page Application 
Single web application nedir
Ajax yollama json dönme sayfanın tamamen yenilenmeden içeriğinin değişmesi olayının teknik anlatımı.. Bir örnek üzerinden anlatılıyor:
The app uses a single-page application (SPA) design. "Single-page application" is the general term for a web application that loads a single HTML page and then updates the page dynamically, instead of loading new pages. After the initial page load, the app talks with the server through AJAX requests. The AJAX requests return JSON data, which the app uses to update the UI.

AJAX isn't new, but today there are JavaScript frameworks that make it easier to build and maintain a large sophisticated SPA application. This tutorial uses Knockout.js, but you can use any JavaScript client framework.

Here are the main building blocks for this app:

ASP.NET MVC creates the HTML page.
ASP.NET Web API handles the AJAX requests and returns JSON data.
Knockout.js data-binds the HTML elements to the JSON data.
Entity Framework talks to the database.

XHTML   	(GITHUB) (test)

What Is XHTML?
XHTML stands for EXtensible HyperText Markup Language
XHTML is almost identical to HTML
XHTML is stricter than HTML
XHTML is HTML defined as an XML application
XHTML is supported by all major browsers 
-
Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML) is part of the family of XML markup languages. It mirrors or extends versions of the widely used HyperText Markup Language (HTML), the language in which Web pages are formulated.
While HTML, prior to HTML5, was defined as an application of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), a flexible markup language framework, XHTML is an application of XML, a more restrictive subset of SGML. XHTML documents are well-formed and may therefore be parsed using standard XML parsers, unlike HTML, which requires a lenient HTML-specific parser.
-
XHTML stands for EXtensible HyperText Markup Language. It is the next step to evolution of internet. The XHTML was developed by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). It helps web developers to make the transition from HTML to XML. Using XHTML, developers can enter the XML world with all the features of it, and they can still remain confident about the backward and future compatibility of the content. The XHTML 1.0 is the first document type in the XHTML family and it is Recommended by W3C in 26 January 2000. The XHTML 1.1 is Recommended by W3c in 31 May 2001. The XHTML5 is a standard and is used to develop an XML adaptation of the HTML5 specification.
The XHTML documents contains three parts, which are discussed below:
•	DOCTYPE: It is used to declare a DTD
•	head: The head section is used to declare the title and other attributes.
•	body: The body tag contains the content of web pages. It consists many tags.

-
Why XHTML?
Many pages on the internet contain "bad" HTML.
This HTML code works fine in most browsers (even if it does not follow the HTML rules):
<html>
<head>
  <title>This is bad HTML</title>

<body>
  <h1>Bad HTML
  <p>This is a paragraph
</body>

Today's market consists of different browser technologies. Some browsers run on computers, and some browsers run on mobile phones or other small devices. Smaller devices often lack the resources or power to interpret "bad" markup.
XML is a markup language where documents must be marked up correctly (be "well-formed").
XHTML was developed by combining the strengths of HTML and XML.
XHTML is HTML redesigned as XML.

XHTML Elements Must Be Properly Nested
In HTML, some elements can be improperly nested within each other, like this:
<b><i>This text is bold and italic</b></i>
In XHTML, all elements must be properly nested within each other, like this:
<b><i>This text is bold and italic</i></b>

XHTML Elements Must Always Be Closed
This is wrong:
<p>This is a paragraph
<p>This is another paragraph
This is correct:
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
<p>This is another paragraph</p>
________________________________________
Empty Elements Must Also Be Closed
This is wrong:
A break: <br>
A horizontal rule: <hr>
An image: <img src="happy.gif" alt="Happy face">
This is correct:
A break: <br />
A horizontal rule: <hr />
An image: <img src="happy.gif" alt="Happy face" />
XHTML Elements Must Be In Lower Case
This is wrong:
<BODY>
<P>This is a paragraph</P>
</BODY>
This is correct:
<body>
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
</body>
XHTML Attribute Names Must Be In Lower Case
This is wrong:
<table WIDTH="100%">
This is correct:
<table width="100%">
Attribute Values Must Be Quoted
This is wrong:
<table width=100%>
This is correct:
<table width="100%">
Attribute Minimization Is Forbidden
Wrong:
<input type="checkbox" name="vehicle" value="car" checked />
Correct:
<input type="checkbox" name="vehicle" value="car" checked="checked" />
Wrong:
<input type="text" name="lastname" disabled />
Correct:
<input type="text" name="lastname" disabled="disabled" />

RESTful API  
(representational state transfer)    	(GITHUB) (örnek)
Restful api nedir?

A RESTful API is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data.
A RESTful API -- also referred to as a RESTful web service -- is based on representational state transfer (REST) technology, an architectural style and approach to communications often used in web services development.
REST technology is generally preferred to the more robust Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) technology because REST leverages less bandwidth, making it more suitable for internet usage. An API for a website is code that allows two software programs to communicate with each another . The API spells out the proper way for a developer to write a program requesting services from an operating system or other application.

UX (User Experience) 	(GITHUB) 	(örnek)
UI ve UX çoğu kez beraber kullanılmalarına rağmen aslında çok farklı iki alandır. UI konusunda olmasa bile UX konusunda çok geride olan ülkemizde, maalesef bu işi profesyonel olarak yapan insanlar bile aralarındaki farkı çok bilmiyorlar. Ülkemizde bir UXD (User Interface Designer) ile tanışmanız çok zor. Türkiye’de bu işle ilgili çoğu insanın özgeçmişinde “UI/UX” yazar. Bunun bir sebebi aralarındaki farkın bilinmemesi, diğer sebebi ise internet sektörünü geriden takip etmemizden dolayı bu işi iki parçaya bölmenin bir lüks olarak görünmesidir.

UI ve UX arasındaki farklar nelerdir ?
The UI is often talked about in conjunction with user experience (UX), which may include the aesthetic appearance of the device, response time and the content that is presented to the user within the context of the user interface. Both terms fall under the concept of human-computer interaction (HCI), which is the field of study focusing on the creation of computer technology and the interaction between humans and all forms of IT design. Specifically, HCI studies areas such as UCD, UI design and UX design.
An increasing focus on creating an optimized user experience has led some to carve out careers as UI and UX experts. Certain languages, such as HTML and CSS, have been geared toward making it easier to create a strong user interface and experience.

UI ingilizce User Interface'in (kullanıcı arayüzü) kısaltılmış hali, UX ise ingilizce User Experience'in (kullanıcı deneyimi) kısaltılmış halidir. UX, içinde UI'i de içeren bir çok disiplini de içeren daha büyük bir halkadır, yani UX > UI diyebiliriz. UX, bir kullanıcının ilgili şeyi (ürünü, hizmeti, web sitesini...) kullanırken, tasarım, kolay kullanım, kolay anlama, kullanırken memnun kalma gibi daha geniş bir perspektifte değerlendirir. UI ise bu deneyimin tasarım kısmını ifade eder. 
UI ve UX arasındaki farkı basit bir örnekle anlatalım. UX bir binanın tasarımını yapan mimar gibidir. Oda yerleşimleri ve büyüklükleri nasıl olacak, hangi malzemeler kullanılacak, ışıklandırma ve renkler nasıl olacak tüm bunları hesaplar, planlar... Tüm planlanan işlerin yapılması ise UI'dir. Görüldüğü gibi UX birden fazla disiplini içinde barındıran, daha çok planlamayı içeren ancak alt disiplinlerle ilgili  yeterli derecede bilgiyi barındıran, daha çok soyut bir çıktı veren bir alandır. UI ise, somut bir çıktı veren bir alandır. UI bir kahveyi içmek için gereken bardağı tasarlamış, UX ise buna ek olarak kahveyi içenin elinin yanmaması için bir bardak daha eklemiş. UX, UI'den farklı olarak kullanıcının ilgili ürünü kullanırken karşılaşabileceği problemleri de düşünür ve bunlarada çözümler bulur.

Web Indexing		(GITHUB) 	(örnek)
web indexing nedir, web Indexing nedir
Web indexing, or internet indexing, comprises methods for indexing the contents of a website or of the Internet as a whole. Individual websites or intranets may use a back-of-the-book index, while search engines usually use keywords and metadata to provide a more useful vocabulary for Internet or onsite searching. With the increase in the number of periodicals that have articles online, web indexing is also becoming important for periodical websites.[1]
Back-of-the-book-style web indexes may be called "web site A-Z indexes".[2] The implication with "A-Z" is that there is an alphabetical browse view or interface. This interface differs from that of a browse through layers of hierarchical categories (also known as a taxonomy) which are not necessarily alphabetical, but are also found on some web sites. Although an A-Z index could be used to index multiple sites, rather than the multiple pages of a single site, this is unusual.
Metadata web indexing involves assigning keywords or phrases to web pages or web sites within a metadata tag (or "meta-tag") field, so that the web page or web site can be retrieved with a search engine that is customized to search the keywords field.[2] This may or may not involve using keywords restricted to a controlled vocabulary list. This method is commonly used by search engine indexing.

Web Crawler		(GITHUB) 	(örnek)
crawler nedir, web crawler nedir, webcrawler nedir
A Web crawler, sometimes called a spider or spiderbot and often shortened to crawler, is an Internet bot that systematically browses the World Wide Web, typically for the purpose of Web indexing (web spidering).
Web search engines and some other sites use Web crawling or spidering software to update their web content or indices of others sites' web content. Web crawlers copy pages for processing by a search engine which indexes the downloaded pages so users can search more efficiently.
Crawlers consume resources on visited systems and often visit sites without approval. Issues of schedule, load, and "politeness" come into play when large collections of pages are accessed. Mechanisms exist for public sites not wishing to be crawled to make this known to the crawling agent. For example, including a robots.txt file can request bots to index only parts of a website, or nothing at all.

Smalltalk	(edited) (test)
smalltalk nedir
Xerox PARC'ta (Palo Alto Research Center) geliştirilmiş nesne yönelimli bir programlama dilidir.
Definition - What does Smalltalk mean?
Smalltalk is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language that incorporates dynamic runtime typing methodology and maneuverability.

Mostly used for application modeling, Smalltalk was created based on basic object principles, which dictate that each thing is an object, and each object can communicate with other objects.

Smalltalk was initially released as version Smalltalk-80 in the 1970s by the Learning Research Group at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center Inc.
Techopedia explains Smalltalk
Because Smalltalk is dynamic and does not require variable type declarations, processing is determined by the receiving object. Type checking is performed at run time, rather than compiling time. Smalltalk also offers tremendous runtime application modification and maneuverability, which extends to syntax or the integrated development environment (IDE).

The central concept in Smalltalk is an object, which is an instance of a class. The three operations performed by a Smalltalk object are:
•	Receive messages from itself or other objects
•	Send messages to itself or another object
•	Reference other objects.
Messaging is the most important concept in Smalltalk. Upon receiving a message, the receiver determines whether it is appropriate. A message can be sent to any object. Other objects can query the state only by sending messages to the object. The language construct in Smalltalk are messages. By default, Smalltalk uses a synchronous, single dynamic message dispatch strategy. Expressions in Smalltalk include multiple message send.

Smalltalk considers primitive values such as integers, Booleans and characters as objects because they are instances of corresponding classes, and operations on them are invoked by sending messages. A programmer can change the classes that implement primitive values to define new behavior for their instances. Classes and code blocks are objects in Smalltalk. Each class is an instance of the metaclass of that class where metaclasses are also objec

JPA / Java Persistence API   	(GITHUB) 	(örnek)
The Java ORM standard for storing, accessing, and managing Java objects in a relational database.
As a specification, the Java Persistence API is concerned with persistence, which loosely means any mechanism by which Java objects outlive the application process that created them. Not all Java objects need to be persisted, but most applications persist key business objects. The JPA specification lets you define which objects should be persisted, and how those objects should be persisted in your Java applications.
By itself, JPA is not a tool or framework; rather, it defines a set of concepts that can be implemented by any tool or framework. While JPA's object-relational mapping (ORM) model was originally based on Hibernate, it has since evolved. Likewise, while JPA was originally intended for use with relational/SQL databases, some JPA implementations have been extended for use with NoSQL datastores. A popular framework that supports JPA with NoSQL is EclipseLink, the reference implementation for JPA 2.2.
JPA 2.2 in Jakarta EE
The Java Persistence API was first released as a subset of the EJB 3.0 specification (JSR 220) in Java EE 5. It has since evolved as its own spec, starting with the release of JPA 2.0 in Java EE 6 (JSR 317). As of this writing, JPA 2.2 has been adopted for continuation as part of Jakarta EE.
JPA and Hibernate
Because of their intertwined history, Hibernate and JPA are frequently conflated. However, like the Java Servlet specification, JPA has spawned many compatible tools and frameworks; Hibernate is just one of them.

What is Java ORM?
While they differ in execution, every JPA implementation provides some kind of ORM layer. In order to understand JPA and JPA-compatible tools, you need to have a good grasp on ORM.
Object-relational mapping is a task–one that developers have good reason to avoid doing manually. A framework like Hibernate ORM or EclipseLink codifies that task into a library or framework, an ORM layer. As part of the application architecture, the ORM layer is responsible for managing the conversion of software objects to interact with the tables and columns in a relational database. In Java, the ORM layer converts Java classes and objects so that they can be stored and managed in a relational database.
[ Learn Java from beginning concepts to advanced design patterns in this comprehensive 12-part course! ]
By default, the name of the object being persisted becomes the name of the table, and fields become columns. Once the table is set up, each table row corresponds to an object in the application. Object mapping is configurable, but defaults tend to work well.
JPA with NoSQL
Until fairly recently, non-relational databases were uncommon curiosities. The NoSQL movement changed all that, and now a variety of NoSQL databases are available to Java developers. Some JPA implementations have evolved to embrace NoSQL, including Hibernate OGM and EclipseLink.

JSF / JavaServer Faces
java server faces nedir, jsf nedir, javaserver faces nedir, javaserverfaces nedir
JavaServer Faces (JSF) is the Java standard technology for building component-based, event-oriented web interfaces. Like JavaServer Pages (JSP), JSF allows access to server-side data and logic. Unlike JSP, which is essentially an HTML page imbued with server-side capabilities, JSF is an XML document that represents formal components in a logical tree. JSF components are backed by Java objects, which are independent of the HTML and have the full range of Java abilities, including accessing remote APIs and databases.
The key idea to a framework like JSF is to encapsulate (or wrap) client-side technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing developers to build web interfaces without much interaction with these technologies.
This article presents a snapshot of JSF's approach to component-based UI development for Java web applications. Simple examples introduce JSF's MVC architecture, event model, and component library. Examples include new features in JSF 2.3, and we'll use PrimeFaces for our component library.

-JSP / JavaServer Pages 	(GITHUB) 	(örnek)
jsp nedir java server pages nedir, javaserver pages nedir, javaserverpages nedir
JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a Java standard technology that enables you to write dynamic, data-driven pages for your Java web applications. JSP is built on top of the Java Servlet specification. The two technologies typically work together, especially in older Java web applications. From a coding perspective, the most obvious difference between them is that with servlets you write Java code and then embed client-side markup (like HTML) into that code, whereas with JSP you start with the client-side script or markup, then embed JSP tags to connect your page to the Java backend.
JSP is also closely related to JSF (JavaServer Faces), a Java specification for building MVC (model-view-controller) web applications. JSP is a relatively simpler and older technology than JSF, which is the standard for Java web frameworks like Eclipse Mojarra, MyFaces, and PrimeFaces. While it is not uncommon to see JSP used as the frontend for older JSF applications, Facelets is the preferred view technology for modern JSF implementations.
While JSP may not be your first choice for building dynamic web pages, it is a core Java web technology. JSP pages are relatively quick and easy to build, and they interact seamlessly with Java servlets in a servlet container like Tomcat. You will encounter JSP in older Java web applications, and from time to time you may find it useful for building simple, dynamic Java web pages. As a Java developer, you should at least be familiar with JSP.
[ Also on InfoWorld: 10 best API management tools ]
This article will be a quick introduction to JavaServer Pages, including the JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL). Examples show you how to write a simple HTML page, embed JSP tags to connect to a Java servlet, and run the page in a servlet container.
See previous articles in this series to learn more about Java servlets and JavaServer Faces.
JSP in Jakarta EE
Following the release of Java EE 8, Oracle moved stewardship of Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) to the Eclipse Foundation. Going forward, the Java enterprise platform has been rebranded as Jakarta EE. Along with the Java Servlet and JSF specifications, JSP is one of the Java web technologies included for ongoing support and upgrades in Jakarta EE.

Java Servlets     (GITHUB) 	(örnek)
java servlets nedir, servlets nedir
A servlet is a Java programming language class that is used to extend the capabilities of servers that host applications accessed by means of a request-response programming model. Although servlets can respond to any type of request, they are commonly used to extend the applications hosted by web servers. For such applications, Java Servlet technology defines HTTP-specific servlet classes.
Java servlet, Java EE'de Java Servlet API'siyle uyumlu bir Java (programlama) sınıfı olup HTTP istemlerine cevap vermek için kullanılır. Belirli bir istemci-sunucu protokolüne bağlı olmamasına rağmen genelde bu protokolle kullanılır. Servlet kelimesi genelde HTTP servlet yerine bu yüzden kullanılmaktadır.[1] Dolayısıyla bir yazılım uzmanı, Java platformu sayesinde servleti bir Web sunucusuna dinamik içerik eklemek için kullanabilir. Üretilen kod genelde HTML olsa da bazen XML de olabilir. Servletler, CGI ya da ASP.NET gibi Java-dışı Web içerik teknolojilerinin Java'daki karşıt üründür. Servletlerle HTTP çerezleri veya URL yeniden yazımı kullanılarak oturum değişkenlerinin sistem durumunu birçok sunucu hareketleri boyunca koruması sağlanmaktadır.

Apache Hive    (GITHUB) 	(örnek)
apache hive nedir, hive nedir
Apache Hive is a data warehouse software project built on top of Apache Hadoop for providing data query and analysis.[3] Hive gives an SQL-like interface to query data stored in various databases and file systems that integrate with Hadoop. Traditional SQL queries must be implemented in the MapReduce Java API to execute SQL applications and queries over distributed data. Hive provides the necessary SQL abstraction to integrate SQL-like queries (HiveQL) into the underlying Java without the need to implement queries in the low-level Java API. Since most data warehousing applications work with SQL-based querying languages, Hive aids portability of SQL-based applications to Hadoop.[4] While initially developed by Facebook, Apache Hive is used and developed by other companies such as Netflix and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).[5][6] Amazon maintains a software fork of Apache Hive included in Amazon Elastic MapReduce on Amazon Web Services.[7]

Apache Pig[1] is a high-level platform for creating programs that run on Apache Hadoop. The language for this platform is called Pig Latin.[1] Pig can execute its Hadoop jobs in MapReduce, Apache Tez, or Apache Spark.[2] Pig Latin abstracts the programming from the Java MapReduce idiom into a notation which makes MapReduce programming high level, similar to that of SQL for relational database management systems. Pig Latin can be extended using user-defined functions (UDFs) which the user can write in Java, Python, JavaScript, Ruby or Groovy[3] and then call directly from the language.

Apache Spark	  (GITHUB) 	(örnek)
apache spark nedir, spark nedir
Apache Spark is an open-source distributed general-purpose cluster-computing framework. Spark provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance. Originally developed at the University of California, Berkeley's AMPLab, the Spark codebase was later donated to the Apache Software Foundation, which has maintained it since.

Overview
Apache Spark has its architectural foundation in the Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD), a read-only multiset of data items distributed over a cluster of machines, that is maintained in a fault-tolerant way.[2] The Dataframe API was released as an abstraction on top of the RDD, followed by the Dataset API. In Spark 1.x, the RDD was the primary application programming interface (API), but as of Spark 2.x use of the Dataset API is encouraged[3] even though the RDD API is not deprecated.[4][5] The RDD technology still underlies the Dataset API.[6][7]
Spark and its RDDs were developed in 2012 in response to limitations in the MapReduce cluster computing paradigm, which forces a particular linear dataflow structure on distributed programs: MapReduce programs read input data from disk, map a function across the data, reduce the results of the map, and store reduction results on disk. Spark's RDDs function as a working set for distributed programs that offers a (deliberately) restricted form of distributed shared memory.[8]

Apache Impala	  (GITHUB) 	(örnek)
apache Impala nedir, apache impala nedir, impala nedir
What is Impala?
Impala is a MPP (Massive Parallel Processing) SQL query engine for processing huge volumes of data that is stored in Hadoop cluster. It is an open source software which is written in C++ and Java. It provides high performance and low latency compared to other SQL engines for Hadoop.
In other words, Impala is the highest performing SQL engine (giving RDBMS-like experience) which provides the fastest way to access data that is stored in Hadoop Distributed File System.
Why Impala?
Impala combines the SQL support and multi-user performance of a traditional analytic database with the scalability and flexibility of Apache Hadoop, by utilizing standard components such as HDFS, HBase, Metastore, YARN, and Sentry.
•	With Impala, users can communicate with HDFS or HBase using SQL queries in a faster way compared to other SQL engines like Hive.
•	Impala can read almost all the file formats such as Parquet, Avro, RCFile used by Hadoop.
Impala uses the same metadata, SQL syntax (Hive SQL), ODBC driver, and user interface (Hue Beeswax) as Apache Hive, providing a familiar and unified platform for batch-oriented or real-time queries.
Unlike Apache Hive, Impala is not based on MapReduce algorithms. It implements a distributed architecture based on daemon processes that are responsible for all the aspects of query execution that run on the same machines.
Thus, it reduces the latency of utilizing MapReduce and this makes Impala faster than Apache Hive.

Advantages of Impala
Here is a list of some noted advantages of Cloudera Impala.
•	Using impala, you can process data that is stored in HDFS at lightning-fast speed with traditional SQL knowledge.
•	Since the data processing is carried where the data resides (on Hadoop cluster), data transformation and data movement is not required for data stored on Hadoop, while working with Impala.
•	Using Impala, you can access the data that is stored in HDFS, HBase, and Amazon s3 without the knowledge of Java (MapReduce jobs). You can access them with a basic idea of SQL queries.
•	To write queries in business tools, the data has to be gone through a complicated extract-transform-load (ETL) cycle. But, with Impala, this procedure is shortened. The time-consuming stages of loading & reorganizing is overcome with the new techniques such as exploratory data analysis & data discovery making the process faster.
•	Impala is pioneering the use of the Parquet file format, a columnar storage layout that is optimized for large-scale queries typical in data warehouse scenarios.
Features of Impala
Given below are the features of cloudera Impala −
•	Impala is available freely as open source under the Apache license.
•	Impala supports in-memory data processing, i.e., it accesses/analyzes data that is stored on Hadoop data nodes without data movement.
•	You can access data using Impala using SQL-like queries.
•	Impala provides faster access for the data in HDFS when compared to other SQL engines.
•	Using Impala, you can store data in storage systems like HDFS, Apache HBase, and Amazon s3.
•	You can integrate Impala with business intelligence tools like Tableau, Pentaho, Micro strategy, and Zoom data.
•	Impala supports various file formats such as, LZO, Sequence File, Avro, RCFile, and Parquet.
•	Impala uses metadata, ODBC driver, and SQL syntax from Apache Hive.

Relational Databases and Impala
Impala uses a Query language that is similar to SQL and HiveQL. The following table describes some of the key dfferences between SQL and Impala Query language.
Impala	Relational databases
Impala uses an SQL like query language that is similar to HiveQL.	Relational databases use SQL language.
In Impala, you cannot update or delete individual records.	In relational databases, it is possible to update or delete individual records.
Impala does not support transactions.	Relational databases support transactions.
Impala does not support indexing.	Relational databases support indexing.

The Internet of things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. 
The definition of the Internet of things has evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, real-time analytics, machine learning, commodity sensors, and embedded systems.[1] Traditional fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, control systems, automation (including home and building automation), and others all contribute to enabling the Internet of things. In the consumer market, IoT technology is most synonymous with products pertaining to the concept of the "smart home", including devices and appliances (such as lighting fixtures, thermostats, home security systems and cameras, and other home appliances) that support one or more common ecosystems, and can be controlled via devices associated with that ecosystem, such as smartphones and smart speakers.
There are a number of serious concerns about dangers in the growth of IoT, especially in the areas of privacy and security, and consequently industry and governmental moves to address these concerns have begun.

M2M nedir, machine to machine nedir, machine 2 machine nedir

Machine to machine (M2M) is direct communication between devices using any communications channel, including wired and wireless.[1][2] Machine to machine communication can include industrial instrumentation, enabling a sensor or meter to communicate the information it records (such as temperature, inventory level, etc.) to application software that can use it (for example, adjusting an industrial process based on temperature or placing orders to replenish inventory).[3] Such communication was originally accomplished by having a remote network of machines relay information back to a central hub for analysis, which would then be rerouted into a system like a personal computer.[4]
More recent machine to machine communication has changed into a system of networks that transmits data to personal appliances. The expansion of IP networks around the world has made machine to machine communication quicker and easier while using less power.[5] These networks also allow new business opportunities for consumers and suppliers.[6]
History
Wired communication machines have been using signaling to exchange information since the early 20th century. Machine to machine has taken more sophisticated forms since the advent of computer networking automation[7] and predates cellular communication. It has been utilized in applications such as telemetry, industrial, automation, and SCADA.

Full Text Search / Full-text search   	(GITHUB) 	(örnek)
Full Text Search nedir, Full-text search nedir

A full-text database is a compilation of documents in which the complete text of each referenced document is available for online viewing, printing, or downloading. In addition to text documents, images are often included, such as graphs, maps, photos, and diagrams.



In text retrieval, full-text search refers to techniques for searching a single computer-stored document or a collection in a full-text database. Full-text search is distinguished from searches based on metadata or on parts of the original texts represented in databases (such as titles, abstracts, selected sections, or bibliographical references).
In a full-text search, a search engine examines all of the words in every stored document as it tries to match search criteria (for example, text specified by a user). Full-text-searching techniques became common in online bibliographic databases in the 1990s.[verification needed] Many websites and application programs (such as word processing software) provide full-text-search capabilities. Some web search engines, such as AltaVista, employ full-text-search techniques, while others index only a portion of the web pages examined by their indexing systems.[1]

Indexing
When dealing with a small number of documents, it is possible for the full-text-search engine to directly scan the contents of the documents with each query, a strategy called "serial scanning". This is what some tools, such as grep, do when searching.
However, when the number of documents to search is potentially large, or the quantity of search queries to perform is substantial, the problem of full-text search is often divided into two tasks: indexing and searching. The indexing stage will scan the text of all the documents and build a list of search terms (often called an index, but more correctly named a concordance). In the search stage, when performing a specific query, only the index is referenced, rather than the text of the original documents.[2]
The indexer will make an entry in the index for each term or word found in a document, and possibly note its relative position within the document. Usually the indexer will ignore stop words (such as "the" and "and") that are both common and insufficiently meaningful to be useful in searching. Some indexers also employ language-specific stemming on the words being indexed. For example, the words "drives", "drove", and "driven" will be recorded in the index under the single concept word "drive".

full-text database nedir, full text database nedir, complete-text database nedir, complete text database nedir

A full-text database or a complete-text database is a database that contains the complete text of books, dissertations, journals, magazines, newspapers or other kinds of textual documents. They differ from bibliographic databases (which contain only bibliographical metadata, including abstracts in some cases) and non-bibliographic databases (such as directories and numeric databases).
One of the earliest systems was IBM STAIRS, introduced in 1973.
Full-text databases became common about 1990 when computer storage technology made them economic and technologically possible. There are two main classes: an extension of the classical bibliographical databases into full-text databases (e.g. on hosts such as BRS, Dialog, LexisNexis and Westlaw) and Internet-based full-text databases (based on search engines or XML).

Bibliographic database  		(GITHUB) 	(örnek)
Bibliographic database nedir

A bibliographic database is a database of bibliographic records, an organized digital collection of references to published literature, including journal and newspaper articles, conference proceedings, reports, government and legal publications, patents, books, etc. In contrast to library catalogue entries, a large proportion of the bibliographic records in bibliographic databases describe articles, conference papers, etc., rather than complete monographs, and they generally contain very rich subject descriptions in the form of keywords, subject classification terms, or abstracts.[1]
A bibliographic database may be general in scope or cover a specific academic discipline like computer science.[2] A significant number of bibliographic databases are proprietary, available by licensing agreement from vendors, or directly from the indexing and abstracting services that create them.[3]
Many bibliographic databases have evolved into digital libraries, providing the full text of the indexed contents:[citation needed] for instance CORE also mirrors and indexes the full text of scholarly articles and Our Research develops a search engine for open access content found by Unpaywall.[4] Others converge with non-bibliographic scholarly databases to create more complete disciplinary search engine systems, such as Chemical Abstracts or Entrez.

Intermediate language	(GITHUB) (örnek)
Intermediate language nedir
An intermediate language is an abstract programming language used by a compiler as an in-between step when translating a computer program into machine code. Before compiling the program into code for an actual, physical machine, the compiler first translates it into intermediate code suitable for a theoretical, abstract machine. This code is analyzed, and if any opportunities for optimization are identified, the compiler can perform them when performing the translation into assembly language.

Fields, Properties			(GITHUB)
Field nedir Property nedir

süper örnek
Properties expose fields. Fields should (almost always) be kept private to a class and accessed via get and set properties. 
Properties provide a level of abstraction allowing you to change the fields while not affecting the external way they are accessed by the things that use your class.

public class MyClass
{

    // this is a field.  It is private to your class and stores the actual data.
    private string _myField;

    // this is a property. When accessed it uses the underlying field,
    // but only exposes the contract, which will not be affected by the underlying field
    public string MyProperty
    {
        get
        {
            return _myField;
        }
        set
        {
            _myField = value;
        }
    }

    // This is an AutoProperty (C# 3.0 and higher) - which is a shorthand syntax
    // used to generate a private field for you
    public int AnotherProperty{get;set;} 
}

Fields are ordinary member variables or member instances of a class. Properties are an abstraction to get and set their values. Properties are also called accessors because they offer a way to change and retrieve a field if you expose a field in the class as private. Generally, you should declare your member variables private, then declare or define properties for them.

Birisi anlatmış:
Nesneye yönelik programlamanın üç temel ilkesinden biri olan sarmalamayı (encapsulation) uygularken kullanılıyoruz.

Sarmalama ilkesinde, bir sınıf tanımlaması içindeki değerleri tutan asıl değişkenlere (field) doğrudan erişimi engelleriz. Bu değişkenlere değer atamak için özelliklerden (property) yararlanırız. 

Bu değişkenlere değer atarken veya değerini istediklerinde tanımladığımız özellik bloğu otomatik olarak çalıştırılır. Biz de bu bloğun içinde değerleri test eder ve ondan sonra göndeririz veya değiştiririz.

Sınıfı kullanan kişi özelliklere doğrudan erişebilir. Alanlara doğrudan erişemez, erişmemelidir. Aksi halde istenmeyen değerleri bilerek veya yanlışlıkla atayarak sınıfımızın hatalı çalışmasına neden olabilirler.

1.	public class Deneme
2.	{
3.	    // Bu bir alan (field). Asıl genişlik değeri bunda saklanacak. 
4.	    private int genislik;
5.	 
6.	    // Bu (Genislik) bir özellik (property). Sınıfı kullanan bunu değiştirmek istediğinde
7.	    // set ile tanımlanan blok, bunun değerini istediğinde get ile tanımlanan
8.	    // blok otomatik çalıştırılır.
9.		
10.	    public int Genislik
11.	    {
12.		// Genislik özelliğinin değerini istediğinde...
13.	        get
14.	        {
15.		    // ... genislik alanının değerini gönder.
16.	            return genislik; 
17.	        }
18.		// Genislik özelliğinin değerini değiştirmek istediğinde...
19.	        set
20.	        {
21.		    // ... gelen değeri (value ile gelir) genislik alanına ata.
22.	            genislik = value;
23.	        }
24.	    }
25.	}

Tabi bu örnekte kontrol kısmı (ki asıl önemli konudur) yok. Sade olsun diye eklenmedi. Aşağıdakinde ise kontrol ediyoruz. Genellikle değer gönderirken (get bloğunda) varsa değer göndermeden önce yapılacak işler, testler veya ayarlamalar yapılır. Tabi varsa.

Asıl önemli olan set bölümü. Bu bölümde value ile gelen değeri kontrol ederiz ve eğer değer uygun ise alana atarız. Aksi halde bir hata fırlatırız veya varsayılan bir değeri atarız. Tabi değer atamadan önce veya sonra başka yapılacak işlemler de varsa onları da yapabiliriz.

1.	public class Deneme
2.	{

Nested Classes  		(GITHUB)	(read)
Nested class nedir, nested classes nedir, nested nedir
When one class is entirely dependent upon another, you may decide to implement it using a nested class. Nested classes are declared within the scope of an existing class and receive special benefits when they access their parent class's members.

What are Nested Classes?
A nested class is a special type of class that can be created using C#. Normally classes are declared within a namespace, or in the default namespace if one is not specified. A nested class is defined within the code block of another class, which itself may be a nested class to permit multiple nesting levels.

A nested class generally behaves is the same way as any other class. It can be instantiated separately to its parent class and is not instantiated automatically by its parent. However, there are some important differences. One key difference concerns the scope of the class. Normally classes can be either public or internal. A nested class may be declared as private, meaning that the class can only be seen by its parent class and other nested classes within that parent. A nested class may also be declared as protected, allowing it to also be accessed by classes that derive from its parent type. This may be extended to protected internal to allow other classes in the same assembly to access it.

Nested classes are given special access to instances of their parent classes. When an object of a parent class is passed to a method of a nested class, the method is permitted to access the private and protected members of the object. This makes nested classes ideal where a special relationship exists with the parent class that requires access to private members, particularly when the nested class is not required anywhere else and is never used in a standalone capability.

Example Nested Classes

We will start with a simple example of a nested class. In this case, the outer class will describe a sales order in an order-processing system. In this rather contrived design, there is no requirement for an order line to ever be created without an order. Furthermore, there is no need for an order line to be used externally to an order. In this case, it is useful to create an Order class with a nested, private OrderLine class.
NB: The following code uses .NET 3.0 syntax for brevity. For earlier versions of the .NET framework, you will need to expand the property declarations and possibly remove the use of generics.

class Order
{
    private List<OrderLine> _orderLines = new List<OrderLine>();
 
    public void AddOrderLine(string product, int quantity, double price)
    {
        OrderLine line = new OrderLine();
        line.ProductName = product;
        line.Quantity = quantity;
        line.Price = price;
        _orderLines.Add(line);
    }
 
    public double OrderTotal()
    {
        double total = 0;
        foreach (OrderLine line in _orderLines)
        {
            total += line.OrderLineTotal();
        }
        return total;
    }
 
    // Nested class
    private class OrderLine
    {
        public string ProductName { get; set; }
        public int Quantity { get; set; }
        public double Price { get; set; }
 
        public double OrderLineTotal()
        {
            return Price * Quantity;
        }
    }
}





The code above shows the simplified Order and nested OrderLine classes. The Order class has two public members. The first allows an item to be added to a private collection of order lines. The product name, price and quantity are passed to this method, which builds an OrderLine object and adds it to the list. The second method loops through each item in the collection and calculates the total value for the order.
The nested OrderLine class is used to represent order lines. It includes properties for the product name, quantity and price and a single method that calculates the total price for the order line. As the class is marked as private, it is invisible to all classes except its parent and any other nested classes that we may later create within Order. We could change the access modifier for the nested class to protected if we wished it to be visible to classes that inherit from Order.
We can test the order mechanism with the following code. This creates an order with two order lines and outputs the total value to the console:


Order order = new Order();
order.AddOrderLine("Cheese", 5, 1.99);
order.AddOrderLine("Oranges", 12, 0.35);
Console.WriteLine(order.OrderTotal());  // Outputs "14.15"

Increasing Nested Class Visibility
As our ordering system evolves, we may decide that it would be useful to permit other classes access to the nested OrderLine class. We could then modify the AddOrderLine method to accept an OrderLine object rather than its constituent parts. We can do this by changing the access modifier of the nested class to internal, protected internal or public, depending upon the requirements. The following code shows a new version of the code:

class Order
{
    private List<OrderLine> _orderLines = new List<OrderLine>();
 
    public void AddOrderLine(OrderLine line)
    {
        _orderLines.Add(line);
    }
 
    public double OrderTotal()
    {
        double total = 0;
        foreach (OrderLine line in _orderLines)
        {
            total += line.OrderLineTotal();
        }
        return total;
    }
 
    // Nested class
    internal class OrderLine
    {
        public string ProductName { get; set; }
        public int Quantity { get; set; }
        public double Price { get; set; }
 
        public double OrderLineTotal()
        {
            return Price * Quantity;
        }
    }
}


With the new versions of the classes, the code that creates an order will also be different. Rather than passing the product details as separate variables, the calling class will instantiate order lines and pass these to the AddOrderLine method. When instantiating a nested class, the name of the class must be qualified by prefixing it with the parent class's name, as in the following, updated example. Note that the order lines are created as Order.OrderLine objects.

Order order = new Order();
 
Order.OrderLine line1 = new Order.OrderLine(); //vaaay olaya gel

line1.ProductName = "Cheese";
line1.Quantity = 5;
line1.Price = 1.99;
order.AddOrderLine(line1);
 
Order.OrderLine line2 = new Order.OrderLine();
line2.ProductName = "Oranges";
line2.Quantity = 12;
line2.Price = 0.35;
order.AddOrderLine(line2);
 
Console.WriteLine(order.OrderTotal());


Accessing Private Members of the Parent Class
The final example will demonstrate the ability for nested classes to access private members of their parent classes. In this example, we have modified the order to include a discount multiplier. The multiplier is held as a private variable that may have been initialised using a constructor or a property. In this case the value is fixed at 0.85. Every order line value will be multiplied by this amount to give a 15% discount.
To allow the order lines to access the discount multiplier, the OrderLineTotal method has been updated to include a parameter. This parameter accepts an Order object. The method retrieves the private discount multiplier from the Order and includes it in the calculation, rounding the result to two decimal places on a line-by-line basis. If the OrderLine class was not nested within Order, this would not be possible.

class Order
{
    private List<OrderLine> _orderLines = new List<OrderLine>();
    private double DiscountMultiplier = 0.85;
 
    public void AddOrderLine(OrderLine line)
    {
        _orderLines.Add(line);
    }
 
    public double OrderTotal()
    {
        double total = 0;
        foreach (OrderLine line in _orderLines)
        {
            total += line.OrderLineTotal(this);
        }
        return total;
    }
 
    // Nested class
    internal class OrderLine
    {
        public string ProductName { get; set; }
        public int Quantity { get; set; }
        public double Price { get; set; }
 
        public double OrderLineTotal(Order order)
        {
            return Math.Round(Price * Quantity * order.DiscountMultiplier, 2);
        }
    }
}

NB: Although nested classes can access the private members of their parent class, the reverse is not true. Private members of nested classes are invisible to their parent class.
-
C# supports nested classes: a class that is a member of another class.
For example:

        class Car
        {
            string name;
            public Car(string nm)
            {
                name = nm;
                Motor m = new Motor();
            }
            public class Motor
            {
                // some code
            }
        }

The Motor class is nested in the Car class and can be used similar to other members of the class.
A nested class acts as a member of the class, so it can have the same access modifiers as other members (public, private, protected).

multi tenant nedir, multi tenancy nedir, multitenant nedir, multi-tenant nedir
What are the advantages of a multi-tenancy SaaS architecture? How does it differ from single tenant instances? We break down the differences and highlight the benefits of implementing a SaaS solution for data protection in this blog.
MULTI-TENANCY – A CORE BENEFIT OF SAAS
In the early days of the cloud, organizations were reluctant to adopt cloud strategies. Few organizations considered applying policies, technologies, and controls to protect data across the cloud. The last several years, which has seen the proven effectiveness of cloud deployments in scalability, cost, and security, has changed that however. Now we’re seeing the rapid adoption of cloud platforms by organizations of all shapes and sizes.
Digital Guardian’s Data Protection Platform leverages software as a service, or SaaS, to provide data protection in a package that results in superior security, better economics, and reduced overhead. One of the ways we do this is through multi-tenant architecture.
SINGLE TENANT VS MULTI-TENANT – LEARN THE DIFFERENCE
Single Tenant – A single instance of the software and supporting infrastructure serve a single customer. With single tenancy, each customer has his or her own independent database and instance of the software. Essentially, there is no sharing happening with this option.


Potential benefits of single-tenant include:
•	Security: A single customer and a single server is often contained on secure hardware being used by a limited number of people.
•	Dependability: With an entire environment dedicated to one client, resources are abundant and available anytime.
•	Customization: Control over the entire environment allows for customization and added functionality, if desired.
Potential drawbacks of single-tenant:
•	Maintenance: Single-tenant typically means more tasks and regular maintenance to keep things running smoothly and efficiently.
•	Setup/Management: By comparison, SaaS multi-tenant environments are quick to setup and manage.
•	Cost: Single-tenant typically allows for more resources, but at a premium price given that there is only one customer for the entire environment.
Multi-Tenant – Multi-tenancy means that a single instance of the software and its supporting infrastructure serves multiple customers. Each customer shares the software application and also shares a single database. Each tenant’s data is isolated and remains invisible to other tenants.
Potential benefits of multi-tenant:
•	Affordable Cost: Multiple customers means that the cost for the environment is shared, and those savings (from the SaaS vendor) are typically transferred to the cost of the software.
•	Integrations: Cloud environments allow for easier integration with other applications through the use of APIs.
•	“Hands-free” Maintenance: The server technically belongs to the SaaS vendor, meaning that a certain level of database maintenance is handled by the vendor, instead of you maintaining the environment yourself.
Potential drawbacks of multi-tenant:
•	Limited Management/Customization: While you do have added integration benefits, custom changes to the database aren’t typically an option.
•	Security: Other tenants won’t see your data. However, multiple users (not associated with your organization) are allowed on the same database. This broader access reduces control of security.
•	Updates/Changes: If you’re reliant on integrations with other SaaS products and one updates their system, it may cause issues with those connecting apps.

BENEFITS OF SAAS MULTI-TENANT ARCHITECTURE
•	Lower costs through economies of scale: With multi-tenancy, scaling has far fewer infrastructure implications than with a single-tenancy-hosted solution because new users get access to the same basic software.
•	Shared infrastructure leads to lower costs: SaaS allows companies of all sizes to share infrastructure and data center operational costs. There is no need to add applications and more hardware to their environment. Not having to provision or manage any infrastructure or software above and beyond internal resources enables businesses to focus on everyday tasks.
•	Ongoing maintenance and updates: Customers don’t need to pay costly maintenance fees to keep their software up to date. Vendors roll out new features and updates. These are often included with a SaaS subscription.
•	Configuration can be done while leaving the underlying codebase unchanged: Single-tenant-hosted solutions are often customized, requiring changes to an application’s code. This customization can be costly and can make upgrades time-consuming because the upgrade might not be compatible with your environment.
Multi-tenant solutions are designed to be highly configurable so that businesses can make the application perform the way they want. There is no changing the code or data structure, making the upgrade process easy.
Multi-tenancy architecture also allows Digital Guardian to efficiently service everyone from small customers, whose scale may not warrant dedicated infrastructure, to large enterprises that need access to the cloud’s virtually unlimited compute resources. Software development and maintenance costs are shared, driving down expenditures, resulting in savings that are passed onto you, the customers.

C# | is Operator Keyword	(GITHUB)	      (asd)
is nedir, is keyword nedir, is operator nedir

In the development of the software, typecasting is an inescapable thing. In many cases, one needs to convert an object(Type) into another object(Type) and sometimes got InvalidCastException. So, to overcome such types of exception C# provides is operator.
The is operator is used to check if the run-time type of an object is compatible with the given type or not. It returns true if the given object is of the same type otherwise, return false. It also returns false for null objects.
Syntax:
expression is type
Here, the expression will be evaluated to an instance of some type. And type is the name of the type to that the result of the expression is to be converted. If the expression is not null and the object results from evaluating the expression can be converted to the specified type then is operator will return true otherwise it will return false.
Example 1: In the below code, we have three classes i.e. Author, Work and GFG. GFG is the driver class which contains the Main method. Class ‘Author’ and ‘Work’ have data members and method. In the Main method, objects of class Author and Work created and methods of these classes are called using the instance of the class. After that, a bool value bool result; is taken to store the return value of is operator. The line of code i.e. result = a is Author; is used to check whether a(object of class author) is of type Author. It will return true as a is the instance of Author class. But instance w is not of type Author, that’s why it returns false. After that, we are assigning null to object a which will give result false as comparing to an instance of Author.

       int? newInt = 13;
 
       var result1 = newInt is 12;

        // Using is operator 
        result = a is Author; 
        Console.WriteLine("Is a is Author? : {0}", result); 
  
        // Check w is of Author type 
        // using is operator 
        result = w is Author; 
        Console.WriteLine("Is w is Author? : {0}", result); 
  
        // Take the value of a is null 
        a = null; 
  
        // Check null object 
        // Using is operator 
        result = a is Author; 
        Console.WriteLine("Is a is Author? : {0}", result); 
    } 
} 
Output:



Is a is Author? : True
Is w is Author? : False
Is a is Author? : False

Example 2: In the below program, we are checking whether the derived type is of the expression type on the left-hand side of the is operator. If is derived then it will return true otherwise it returns false.

// C# program to illustrate the  
// use of is operator keyword 
using System; 
  
// taking a class 
public class G1 { 
      
} 
  
// taking a class  
// derived from G1 
public class G2 : G1 { 
      
} 
  
// taking a class 
public class G3 { 
      
} 
  
  
// Driver Class 
public class GFG { 
      
    // Main Method 
    public static void Main() 
    { 
        // creating an instance  
        // of class G1 
        G1 obj1 = new G1(); 
          
        // creating an instance  
        // of class G2 
        G2 obj2 = new G2(); 
          
        // checking whether 'obj1' 
        // is of type 'G1' 
        Console.WriteLine(obj1 is G1); 
          
        // checking whether 'obj1' is 
        // of type Object class 
        // (Base class for all classes) 
        Console.WriteLine(obj1 is Object); 
          
        // checking whether 'obj2' 
        // is of type 'G2' 
        Console.WriteLine(obj2 is G2); 
          
        // checking whether 'obj2' is 
        // of type Object class 
        // (Base class for all classes) 
        Console.WriteLine(obj2 is Object); 
          
        // checking whether 'obj2' 
        // is of type 'G1' 
        // it will return true as G2 
        // is derived from G1 
        Console.WriteLine(obj2 is G2); 
          
        // checking whether obj1  
        // is of type G3 
        // it will return false 
        Console.WriteLine(obj1 is G3); 
          
         // checking whether obj2  
        // is of type G3 
        // it will return false 
        Console.WriteLine(obj2 is G3); 
          
          
    } 
} 
Output:
True
True
True
True
True
False
False
Note:
•	Only reference, boxing, and unboxing conversions are considered by the is operator keyword.
•	User-defined conversions or the conversion which are defined using the implicit and explicit are not considered consider by is operator. For the conversions which are known at the compile-time or handled by an implicit operator, is operator will give warnings for that.

Virtual keyword - Lazy Loading - Eager Loading 	(GITHUB)    (asdf)
virtual nedir, virtual keyword nedir, lazyloading nedir, lazy loading nedir, eager loading nedir, eagerloading nedir

This virtual keyword is related to the topic of loading data from entity framework (lazy loading, eager loading and explicit loading).
You should use virtual keyword, when you want to load data with lazy loading.
lazy loading is the process whereby an entity or collection of entities is automatically loaded from the database the first time it is accessed.
For example, when using the Blog entity class defined below, the related Posts will be loaded the first time the Posts navigation property is accessed:
public class Blog 
{  
     public int BlogId { get; set; }  
     public string Name { get; set; }  
     public string Url { get; set; }  
     public string Tags { get; set; }  
     public virtual ICollection<Post> Posts { get; set; }  
}
Lazy loading of the Posts collection can be turned off by making the Posts property non-virtual.
if lazy loading is off, Loading of the Posts collection can still be achieved using eager loading (using Include method) or Explicitly loading related entities (using Load method).
Eagerly Loading:
using (var context = new BloggingContext()) 
{ 
    // Load all blogs and related posts 
    var blogs1 = context.Blogs 
                          .Include(b => b.Posts) 
                          .ToList(); 
}
Explicitly Loading:
using (var context = new BloggingContext()) 
{ 
    var blog = context.Blogs.Find(1); 

    // Load the posts related to a given blog 
    context.Entry(blog).Collection(p => p.Posts).Load(); 
}

Attibute nedir	(testset) (testset)
Attributes provide a powerful method of associating metadata, or declarative information, with code (assemblies, types, methods, properties, and so forth). 
After an attribute is associated with a program entity, the attribute can be queried at run time by using a technique called reflection. For more information, see Reflection (C#).
Attributes have the following properties:
•	Attributes add metadata to your program. Metadata is information about the types defined in a program. All .NET assemblies contain a specified set of metadata that describes the types and type members defined in the assembly. You can add custom attributes to specify any additional information that is required. For more information, see, Creating Custom Attributes (C#).
•	You can apply one or more attributes to entire assemblies, modules, or smaller program elements such as classes and properties.
•	Attributes can accept arguments in the same way as methods and properties.
•	Your program can examine its own metadata or the metadata in other programs by using reflection. For more information, see Accessing Attributes by Using Reflection (C#).

In this example, the SerializableAttribute attribute is used to apply a specific characteristic to a class:
[Serializable]
public class SampleClass
{
    // Objects of this type can be serialized.
}

A method with the attribute DllImportAttribute is declared like the following example:
[System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImport("user32.dll")]
extern static void SampleMethod();
Some attributes can be specified more than once for a given entity. An example of such a multiuse attribute is ConditionalAttribute:
[Conditional("DEBUG"), Conditional("TEST1")]
void TraceMethod()
{
    // ...
}

[DllImport("user32.dll")]
[DllImport("user32.dll", SetLastError=false, ExactSpelling=false)]
[DllImport("user32.dll", ExactSpelling=false, SetLastError=false)]
The first parameter, the DLL name, is positional and always comes first; the others are named. In this case, both named parameters default to false, so they can be omitted. Positional parameters correspond to the parameters of the attribute constructor. Named or optional parameters correspond to either properties or fields of the attribute. Refer to the individual attribute's documentation for information on default parameter values.

Object nedir	(GITHUB) (empty)

A class or struct definition is like a blueprint that specifies what the type can do. An object is basically a block of memory that has been allocated and configured according to the blueprint. A program may create many objects of the same class. Objects are also called instances, and they can be stored in either a named variable or in an array or collection. Client code is the code that uses these variables to call the methods and access the public properties of the object. In an object-oriented language such as C#, a typical program consists of multiple objects interacting dynamically.
-
The words object and instance basically refer to the same thing.
In object oriented programming there is the concept of classes. You can basically do nothing without a class.
A class is the blueprint for creating an object (classes marked as static, abstract etc. are excluded from this statement.), with specific characteristics and behaviour defined in the class. An object can be also called an instance of a class.

For example:
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}
The above is a class. It just defines a type called Person with two properties Name and Age.
When you need a person object (or an instance of this class), you can create it using the new operator and an appropriate constructor (below I use an object initializer).
var person = new Person 
{ 
    Name = "Foo",
    Age = 30
};
Now the person is an object or equivalently an instance of the class Person.

Shadow property nedir	(GITHUB) (asasas)
Shadow properties are properties that are not defined in your .NET entity class but are defined for that entity type in the EF Core model. 
This means that we can have columns for these properties in our tables, but we will not have a corresponding property field in our entity class. This is really helpful while designing our domain models as this helps to avoid unnecessary fields from the domain models which don't add any value to our domain logic but are required in our database.

Continuous Integration?	(GITHUB) (testset)
Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each integration can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests. While automated testing is not strictly part of CI it is typically implied.

Extreme programming	(GITHUB) (testset)

Futbolda her karşısına çıkan oyuncuya çalım atan kişi akla geliyo.. Her bir rakip oyuncu: müşteri isteğindeki değişim… Extreme programming ile proje, her bir engele karşı ilerlemeye devam ediyor.

Extreme programming (XP) is a software development methodology which is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. As a type of agile software development,[1][2][3] it advocates frequent "releases" in short development cycles, which is intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints at which new customer requirements can be adopted.
 
Other elements of extreme programming include: programming in pairs or doing extensive code review, unit testing of all code, not programming features until they are actually needed, a flat management structure, code simplicity and clarity, expecting changes in the customer's requirements as time passes and the problem is better understood, and frequent communication with the customer and among programmers.[2][3][4] The methodology takes its name from the idea that the beneficial elements of traditional software engineering practices are taken to "extreme" levels. As an example, code reviews are considered a beneficial practice; taken to the extreme, code can be reviewed continuously, i.e. the practice of pair programming.

Generic / Generics	(GITHUB) (testset)
Generic nedir, generic class nedir, generics nedir
Generics allow you to define the specification of the data type of programming elements in a class or a method, until it is actually used in the program. In other words, generics allow you to write a class or method that can work with any data type.
You write the specifications for the class or the method, with substitute parameters for data types. When the compiler encounters a constructor for the class or a function call for the method, it generates code to handle the specific data type. A simple example would help understanding the concept −
Live Demo
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace GenericApplication {
   public class MyGenericArray<T> {
      private T[] array;
      
      public MyGenericArray(int size) {
         array = new T[size + 1];
      }
      public T getItem(int index) {
         return array[index];
      }
      public void setItem(int index, T value) {
         array[index] = value;
      }
   }
   class Tester {
      static void Main(string[] args) {
         
         //declaring an int array
         MyGenericArray<int> intArray = new MyGenericArray<int>(5);
         
         //setting values
         for (int c = 0; c < 5; c++) {
            intArray.setItem(c, c*5);
         }
         
         //retrieving the values
         for (int c = 0; c < 5; c++) {
            Console.Write(intArray.getItem(c) + " ");
         }
         
         Console.WriteLine();
         
         //declaring a character array
         MyGenericArray<char> charArray = new MyGenericArray<char>(5);
         
         //setting values
         for (int c = 0; c < 5; c++) {
            charArray.setItem(c, (char)(c+97));
         }
         
         //retrieving the values
         for (int c = 0; c< 5; c++) {
            Console.Write(charArray.getItem(c) + " ");
         }
         Console.WriteLine();
         
         Console.ReadKey();
      }
   }
}
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −
0 5 10 15 20
a b c d e
Features of Generics
Generics is a technique that enriches your programs in the following ways −
•	It helps you to maximize code reuse, type safety, and performance.
•	You can create generic collection classes. The .NET Framework class library contains several new generic collection classes in the System.Collections.Generic namespace. You may use these generic collection classes instead of the collection classes in the System.Collections namespace.
•	You can create your own generic interfaces, classes, methods, events, and delegates.
•	You may create generic classes constrained to enable access to methods on particular data types.
•	You may get information on the types used in a generic data type at run-time by means of reflection.
Generic Methods
In the previous example, we have used a generic class; we can declare a generic method with a type parameter. The following program illustrates the concept −
Live Demo
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace GenericMethodAppl {
   class Program {
      static void Swap<T>(ref T lhs, ref T rhs) {
         T temp;
         temp = lhs;
         lhs = rhs;
         rhs = temp;
      }
      static void Main(string[] args) {
         int a, b;
         char c, d;
         a = 10;
         b = 20;
         c = 'I';
         d = 'V';
         
         //display values before swap:
         Console.WriteLine("Int values before calling swap:");
         Console.WriteLine("a = {0}, b = {1}", a, b);
         Console.WriteLine("Char values before calling swap:");
         Console.WriteLine("c = {0}, d = {1}", c, d);
         
         //call swap
         Swap<int>(ref a, ref b);
         Swap<char>(ref c, ref d);
         
         //display values after swap:
         Console.WriteLine("Int values after calling swap:");
         Console.WriteLine("a = {0}, b = {1}", a, b);
         Console.WriteLine("Char values after calling swap:");
         Console.WriteLine("c = {0}, d = {1}", c, d);
         
         Console.ReadKey();
      }
   }
}
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −
Int values before calling swap:
a = 10, b = 20
Char values before calling swap:
c = I, d = V
Int values after calling swap:
a = 20, b = 10
Char values after calling swap:
c = V, d = I
Generic Delegates
You can define a generic delegate with type parameters. For example −
delegate T NumberChanger<T>(T n);
The following example shows use of this delegate −
Live Demo
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

delegate T NumberChanger<T>(T n);
namespace GenericDelegateAppl {
   class TestDelegate {
      static int num = 10;
      
      public static int AddNum(int p) {
         num += p;
         return num;
      }
      public static int MultNum(int q) {
         num *= q;
         return num;
      }
      public static int getNum() {
         return num;
      }
      static void Main(string[] args) {
         //create delegate instances
         NumberChanger<int> nc1 = new NumberChanger<int>(AddNum);
         NumberChanger<int> nc2 = new NumberChanger<int>(MultNum);
         
         //calling the methods using the delegate objects
         nc1(25);
         Console.WriteLine("Value of Num: {0}", getNum());
         
         nc2(5);
         Console.WriteLine("Value of Num: {0}", getNum());
         Console.ReadKey();
      }
   }
}
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −
Value of Num: 35
Value of Num: 175

C# Generics
Generic means the general form, not specific. In C#, generic means not specific to a particular data type.
C# allows you to define generic classes, interfaces, abstract classes, fields, methods, static methods, properties, events, delegates, and operators using the type parameter and without the specific data type. A type parameter is a placeholder for a particular type specified when creating an instance of the generic type.
A generic type is declared by specifying a type parameter in an angle brackets after a type name, e.g. TypeName<T> where T is a type parameter.
Generic Class
Generic classes are defined using a type parameter in an angle brackets after the class name. The following defines a generic class.
class DataStore<T>
{
    public T Data { get; set; }
}
Above, the DataStore is a generic class. T is called type parameter, which can be used as a type of fields, properties, method parameters, return types, and delegates in the DataStore class. For example, Data is generic property because we have used a type parameter T as its type instead of the specific data type.
 Note
It is not required to use T as a type parameter. You can give any name to a type parameter. Generally, T is used when there is only one type parameter. It is recommended to use a more readable type parameter name as per requirement like TSession, TKey, TValue etc. Learn more about Type Parameter Naming Guidelines
You can also define multiple type parameters separated by a comma.
Example: Generic Class with Multiple Type Parameters
class KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>
{
    public TKey Key { get; set; }
    public TValue Value { get; set; }
}
Instantiating Generic Class
You can create an instance of generic classes by specifying an actual type in angle brackets. The following creates an instance of the generic class DataStore.
DataStore<string> store = new DataStore<string>();
Above, we specified the string type in the angle brackets while creating an instance. So, T will be replaced with a string type wherever T is used in the entire class at compile-time. Therefore, the type of Data property would be a string.
The following figure illustrates how generics works.
 
You can assign a string value to the Data property. Trying to assign values other than string will result in a compile-time error.
DataStore<string> store = new DataStore<string>();
store.Data = "Hello World!";
//obj.Data = 123; //compile-time error
You can specify the different data types for different objects, as shown below.
Example: Generic class
DataStore<string> strStore = new DataStore<string>();
strStore.Data = "Hello World!";
//strStore.Data = 123; // compile-time error

DataStore<int> intStore = new DataStore<int>();
intStore.Data = 100;
//intStore.Data = "Hello World!"; // compile-time error

KeyValuePair<int, string> kvp1 = new KeyValuePair<int, string>();
kvp1.Key = 100;
kvp1.Value = "Hundred";

KeyValuePair<string, string> kvp2 = new KeyValuePair<string, string>();
kvp2.Key = "IT";
kvp2.Value = "Information Technology";

Generic Class Characteristics
•	A generic class increases the reusability. The more type parameters mean more reusable it becomes. However, too much generalization makes code difficult to understand and maintain.
•	A generic class can be a base class to other generic or non-generic classes or abstract classes.
•	A generic class can be derived from other generic or non-generic interfaces, classes, or abstract classes.
Generic Fields
A generic class can include generic fields. However, it cannot be initialized.
Example: Generic Field
class DataStore<T>
{
    public T data;
}
The following declares a generic array.
Example: Generic Array
class DataStore<T>
{
    public T[] data = new T[10];
}
Generic Methods
A method declared with the type parameters for its return type or parameters is called a generic method.
Example: Generic Methods
class DataStore<T>
{
    private T[] _data = new T[10];
    
    public void AddOrUpdate(int index, T item)
    {
        if(index >= 0 && index < 10)
            _data[index] = item;
    }

    public T GetData(int index)
    {
        if(index >= 0 && index < 10)
            return _data[index];
        else 
            return default(T);
    }
}
Above, the AddorUpdate() and the GetData() methods are generic methods. The actual data type of the item parameter will be specified at the time of instantiating the DataStore<T> class, as shown below.
Example: Generic Methods
DataStore<string> cities = new DataStore<string>();
cities.AddOrUpdate(0, "Mumbai");
cities.AddOrUpdate(1, "Chicago");
cities.AddOrUpdate(2, "London");

DataStore<int> empIds = new DataStore<int>();
empIds.AddOrUpdate(0, 50);
empIds.AddOrUpdate(1, 65);
empIds.AddOrUpdate(2, 89);
Try it
The generic parameter type can be used with multiple parameters with or without non-generic parameters and return type. The followings are valid generic method overloading.
Example: Generic Method Overloading
public void AddOrUpdate(int index, T data) { }
public void AddOrUpdate(T data1, T data2) { }
public void AddOrUpdate<U>(T data1, U data2) { }
public void AddOrUpdate(T data) { }
A non-generic class can include generic methods by specifying a type parameter in angle brackets with the method name, as shown below.
Example: Generic Method in Non-generic Class
class Printer
{
    public void Print<T>(T data)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(data);
    }
}

Printer printer = new Printer();
printer.Print<int>(100);
printer.Print(200); // type infer from the specified value
printer.Print<string>("Hello");
printer.Print("World!"); // type infer from the specified value
Try it
Advantages of Generics
1.	Generics increase the reusability of the code. You don't need to write code to handle different data types.
2.	Generics are type-safe. You get compile-time errors if you try to use a different data type than the one specified in the definition.
3.	Generic has a performance advantage because it removes the possibilities of boxing and unboxing.

Abstract class / Abstract method / Abstract keyword
Abstract class nedir, abstract method nedir, abstract keyword nedir

Msdn:
The abstract modifier indicates that the thing being modified has a missing or incomplete implementation. The abstract modifier can be used with classes, methods, properties, indexers, and events. Use the abstract modifier in a class declaration to indicate that a class is intended only to be a base class of other classes, not instantiated on its own. Members marked as abstract must be implemented by non-abstract classes that derive from the abstract class.
Example
In this example, the class Square must provide an implementation of GetArea because it derives from Shape:
abstract class Shape
{
    public abstract int GetArea();
}

class Square : Shape
{
    int side;

    public Square(int n) => side = n;

    // GetArea method is required to avoid a compile-time error.
    public override int GetArea() => side * side;

    static void Main()
    {
        var sq = new Square(12);
        Console.WriteLine($"Area of the square = {sq.GetArea()}");
    }
}
// Output: Area of the square = 144
Abstract classes have the following features:
•	An abstract class cannot be instantiated.
•	An abstract class may contain abstract methods and accessors.
•	It is not possible to modify an abstract class with the sealed modifier because the two modifiers have opposite meanings. The sealed modifier prevents a class from being inherited and the abstract modifier requires a class to be inherited.
•	A non-abstract class derived from an abstract class must include actual implementations of all inherited abstract methods and accessors.
Use the abstract modifier in a method or property declaration to indicate that the method or property does not contain implementation.
Abstract methods have the following features:
•	An abstract method is implicitly a virtual method.
•	Abstract method declarations are only permitted in abstract classes.
•	Because an abstract method declaration provides no actual implementation, there is no method body; the method declaration simply ends with a semicolon and there are no curly braces ({ }) following the signature. For example:
public abstract void MyMethod();  
The implementation is provided by a method override, which is a member of a non-abstract class.
•	It is an error to use the static or virtual modifiers in an abstract method declaration.
Abstract properties behave like abstract methods, except for the differences in declaration and invocation syntax.
•	It is an error to use the abstract modifier on a static property.
•	An abstract inherited property can be overridden in a derived class by including a property declaration that uses the override modifier.
For more information about abstract classes, see Abstract and Sealed Classes and Class Members.
An abstract class must provide implementation for all interface members.
An abstract class that implements an interface might map the interface methods onto abstract methods. For example:
interface I
{
    void M();
}

abstract class C : I
{
    public abstract void M();
}

Example
In this example, the class DerivedClass is derived from an abstract class BaseClass. The abstract class contains an abstract method, AbstractMethod, and two abstract properties, X and Y.
abstract class BaseClass   // Abstract class
{
    protected int _x = 100;
    protected int _y = 150;
    public abstract void AbstractMethod();   // Abstract method
    public abstract int X    { get; }
    public abstract int Y    { get; }
}

class DerivedClass : BaseClass
{
    public override void AbstractMethod()
    {
        _x++;
        _y++;
    }

    public override int X   // overriding property
    {
        get
        {
            return _x + 10;
        }
    }

    public override int Y   // overriding property
    {
        get
        {
            return _y + 10;
        }
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        var o = new DerivedClass();
        o.AbstractMethod();
        Console.WriteLine($"x = {o.X}, y = {o.Y}");
    }
}
// Output: x = 111, y = 161
In the preceding example, if you attempt to instantiate the abstract class by using a statement like this:
BaseClass bc = new BaseClass();   // Error  
You will get an error saying that the compiler cannot create an instance of the abstract class 'BaseClass'.

www nedir, world wide web nedir
World Wide Web, Dünya Çapında Ağ (kısaca WWW veya Web), İnternet üzerinde yayınlanan birbirleriyle bağlantılı hiper-metin dokümanlarından oluşan bir bilgi sistemidir. Bu dokümanların her birine Web sayfası adı verilir ve Web sayfalarına İnternet kullanıcısının bilgisayarında çalışan Web tarayıcısı adı verilen bilgisayar programları aracılığıyla erişilir. Web sayfalarında metin, imaj, video ve diğer multimedya ögeleri bulunabilir ve diğer bağlantı ya da link adı verilen hiper-bağlantılar ile başka Web sayfalarına geçiş yapılabilir.

İnternet ve Web terimleri aynı olguyu tanımlamaz. Zira Web sadece İnternet üzerinde çalışan bir servistir. Web kavramı, CERN'de bir bilgisayar programcısı olan Tim Berners-Lee'nin HTML adlı metin işaretleme dilini geliştirmesiyle oluşmuştur. Bugün de kendisinin başkanı olduğu W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) tarafından standartları belirlenmektedir.

Yapısı
Web’in temeli İnternet'tir. Web İnternet üzerinde kurulmuştur ve İnternet'in sunduğu mekanizmalardan çoğunun kullanılmasını sağlar. İnternet'in fiziksel görünüşleri –bilgisayarlar, ağlar ve servisler– Dünya üzerindeki diğer binlerce bilgisayara bağlanmamıza izin verir. Web, İnternet'in en tepesindeki soyutlanmış genel servisler kümesidir. World Wide Web (W3), insanların fikir ve projelerinin paylaşılmasını sağlayan bir bilgi ve kültür havuzudur. İstemci-sunucu uygulamaları ile yapılan birçok organizasyon üzerinde Web tarayıcıları istemci olarak çalışabilirler. Web yürütümü standart İstemci-sunucu modelini izler. Aşağıdaki şekilde gösterildiği gibi "Web tarayıcısı" adı verilen programı çalıştıran bir istemci bilgisayar ile Web sunucu yazılımı çalıştıran bir sunucu bilgisayar arasındaki etkileşime "istemci-sunucu" etkileşimi adı verilir. İstemci bilgisayar sunucudan HTTP'yi (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) ve İnternet mesaj standardı TCP/IP'yi kullanarak bir doküman ister ve sunucu istemcinin göstereceği dokümanı geri döndürür.

Abstract Classes and Methods	(GITHUB) (testset)
Abstraction nedir, abstract class nedir, abstract method nedir
Abstraction
Abstraction is a process to abstract or hide the functionality and provide users or other programmers to use it only. Like for the method Console.WriteLine(), no one knows what actually is happening behind the function calling. We are just using it by calling and passing the arguments. This is the thing called Abstraction.
Encapsulation
Encapsulation means to encapsulate or put everything into one thing and provide others to use it. Like in a shaving kit, all the necessary kits are available. And also these kits are available as loose in market. But the shaving kit encapsulates every other kit into a small bag and provides a user to use it.
Hope you now have a basic idea about both of these properties. Let's see a real world example of encapsulation and abstraction.
Let's assume you have to create a method to insert users data and pass it to other developers to use. So first, create a class and add a method to insert the data into database with validation.
There will be three fields:
1.	Name
2.	Email
3.	Phone number
So these inputs have to validate first and then insert into db.
First, create a class with all methods:
Hide   Copy Code
class User
{
    public bool AddUser(string name, string email, string phone)
    {
        if (ValidateUser(name, email, phone))
        {
            if (AddtoDb(name, email, phone) > 0)
            {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    private bool ValidateUser(string name, string email, string phone)
    {
        // do your validation
        return true;
    }

    private int AddtoDb(string name, string email, string phone)
    {
        // Write the Db code to insert the data
        return 1;
    }
}
As you can see, there are three methods that are written in this User class.
•	AddUser: To call from outside the class. That is why the access modifier is public.
•	validateUser: To validate the user's details. Can't access from outside the class. It's private.
•	AddtoDb: To insert data into database table and again it is private, can't access from outside the class.
Now another user will just call AddUser method with parameters. And that user has no idea what is actually happening inside the method. I didn't write the code to validate and insert into db, as you can get it from others examples. We will discuss about it later.
To call the AddUser method, do as follows:
Hide   Copy Code
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        User objUser = new User();
        bool f = objUser.AddUser("Arka", "ark@g.com", "1234567890");
    }
}
Now come back to the main discussion.
Here, we are hiding the procedure of adding data into database from other users, this is Abstraction. And putting all the three methods into one User class and providing other users to use it, that is called Encapsulation.
So procedure hiding is Abstraction and putting every necessary thing into one is Encapsulation.
Hope you have cleared your doubts about the concepts of Encapsulation and Abstraction. CodeProject

In c#, Abstraction is a principle of object-oriented programming language (OOP) and it is used to hide the implementation details and display only essential features of the object.
 
In Abstraction, by using access modifiers we can hide the required details of the object and expose only necessary methods and properties through the reference of an object.
 
In real-time, the laptop is a perfect example of abstraction in c#. A laptop that consists of many things such as processor, RAM, motherboard, LCD screen, camera, USB ports, battery, speakers, etc. To use it, we just need to know how to operate the laptop by switching it on, we don’t need to know how internally all the parts are working. Here, the laptop is an object which is designed to expose only required features by hiding its implementation details.
 
In object-oriented programming, a class is the perfect example of abstraction. In c#, we can create a class with required methods, properties and we can expose only necessary methods and properties using access modifiers based on our requirements.
 
Following is the example of defining a class with required methods, properties and exposing it by using access modifiers to achieve abstraction functionality.
 
public class Laptop
{
    private string brand;
    private string model;
    public string Brand
    {
        get { return brand; }
        set { brand = value; }
    }
    public string Model
    {
        get { return model; }
        set { model = value; }
    }
    public void LaptopDetails()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Brand: " + Brand);
        Console.WriteLine("Model: " + Model);
    }
    public void LaptopKeyboard()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Type using Keyword");
    }
    private void MotherBoardInfo()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("MotheBoard Information");
    }
    private void InternalProcessor()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Processor Information");
    }
}
If you observe the above code, we defined a Laptop class with required fields, properties and methods with the public, private access modifiers to achieve an abstraction functionality by hiding and exposing some of the methods and properties based on our requirements.
 
Here, the public modifier is used to allow defined fields, properties and methods to access outside of the class and the private modifier is used to hide or restrict access of required fields, properties and methods from the outside of class.
 
By creating an instance of Laptop class we can access defined fields, properties, and methods. Following is the pictorial representation of creating an instance of a class and accessing fields, properties and methods.
 
 
 
If you observe the above diagram, we are exposing only the necessary properties and methods outside of the class by using public and private access modifiers.
C# Abstraction Example
Following is the example of implementing an abstraction functionality by allowing only a few properties and methods to access outside of the class in c# programming language.
 
using System;
using System.Text;
 
namespace Tutlane
{
    public class Laptop
    {
        private string brand;
        private string model;
        public string Brand
        {
            get { return brand; }
            set { brand = value; }
        }
        public string Model
        {
            get { return model; }
            set { model = value; }
        }
        public void LaptopDetails()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Brand: " + Brand);
            Console.WriteLine("Model: " + Model);
        }
        public void LaptopKeyboard()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Type using Keyword");
        }
        private void MotherBoardInfo()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("MotheBoard Information");
        }
        private void InternalProcessor()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Processor Information");
        }
    }
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Laptop l = new Laptop();
            l.Brand = "Dell";
            l.Model = "Inspiron 14R";
            l.LaptopDetails();
            Console.WriteLine("\nPress Enter Key to Exit..");
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}
If you observe above example, we defined a fields, properties and methods with public, private access modifiers to allow or disallow properties, methods access based on requirements.
 
When you execute the above c# program, you will get the result as shown below.
 
 
Difference between Abstraction and Encapsulation
The following are the differences between abstraction and encapsulation in c# programming language.
 
Abstraction	Encapsulation
It is used to hide unwanted data and shows only the required properties and methods.	It is used to bind data members and member functions into a single unit to prevent outsiders to access it directly.
This is how we can use abstraction to hide implementation details and showing only essential features based on our requirements in c# programing language. 

-
Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.
Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces (which you will learn more about in the next chapter).
The abstract keyword is used for classes and methods:
•	Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).


•	Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the derived class (inherited from).
An abstract class can have both abstract and regular methods:

abstract class Animal 
{
  public abstract void animalSound();
  public void sleep() 
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Zzz");
  }
}
 
 
From the example above, it is not possible to create an object of the Animal class:
Animal myObj = new Animal(); // Will generate an error (Cannot create an instance of the abstract class or interface 'Animal')
To access the abstract class, it must be inherited from another class. Let's convert the Animal class we used in the Polymorphism chapter to an abstract class.
Remember from the Inheritance chapter that we use the : symbol to inherit from a class, and that we use the override keyword to override the base class method.
Example
// Abstract class
abstract class Animal
{
  // Abstract method (does not have a body)
  public abstract void animalSound();
  // Regular method
  public void sleep()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Zzz");
  }
}

// Derived class (inherit from Animal)
class Pig : Animal
{
  public override void animalSound()
  {
    // The body of animalSound() is provided here
    Console.WriteLine("The pig says: wee wee");
  }
}

class Program
{
  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Pig myPig = new Pig(); // Create a Pig object
    myPig.animalSound();  // Call the abstract method
    myPig.sleep();  // Call the regular method
  }
}

Abstraction
 
Abstraction allows us to represent complex real world in simplest manner. It is process of identifying the relevant qualities and behaviors an object should possess, in other word represent the necessary feature without representing the back ground details. Abstraction is a process of hiding work style of an object and showing only those information which are required to understand the object. Abstraction means putting all the variables and methods in a class which are necessary.
 
Encapsulation
 
It is a process of hiding all the internal details of an object from the outside real world. The word Encapsulation, like Enclosing into the capsule. It restrict client from seeing its internal view where behavior of the abstraction is implemented. In Encapsulation, generally to hide data making it private and expose public property to access those data from outer world. Encapsulation is a method for protecting data from unwanted access or alteration. Encapsulation is the mechanism by which Abstraction is implemented.
 
Difference between Abstraction and Encapsulation
 
Abstraction is a process. It is the act of identifying the relevant qualities and behaviors an object should possess. Encapsulation is the mechanism by which the abstraction is implemented.

Abstraction	Encapsulation
Abstraction solves the problem in the design level.	Encapsulation solves the problem in the implementation level.
Abstraction is used for hiding the unwanted data and giving onlyrelevant data.	Encapsulation is hiding the code and data into a single unit toprotect the data from outer world.
Abstraction is set focus on the object instead of how it does it.	Encapsulation means hiding the internal details or mechanics of howan object does something.
Abstraction is outer layout in terms of design.
For Example: - Outer Look of a iPhone, like it has a display screen.	Encapsulation is inner layout in terms of implementation.
For Example: - Inner Implementation detail of a iPhone, how DisplayScreen are connect with each other using circuits

Cyclomatic Complexity
Cyclomatic complexity nedir
Cyclomatic complexity of a code section is the quantitative measure of the number of linearly independent paths in it. It is a software metric used to indicate the complexity of a program. It is computed using the Control Flow Graph of the program. The nodes in the graph indicate the smallest group of commands of a program, and a directed edge in it connects the two nodes i.e. if second command might immediately follow the first command. 
For example, if source code contains no control flow statement then its cyclomatic complexity will be 1 and source code contains a single path in it. Similarly, if the source code contains one if condition then cyclomatic complexity will be 2 because there will be two paths one for true and the other for false. 
Mathematically, for a structured program, the directed graph inside control flow is the edge joining two basic blocks of the program as control may pass from first to second. 
So, cyclomatic complexity M would be defined as, 
 
M = E – N + 2P 
where, 
E = the number of edges in the control flow graph 
N = the number of nodes in the control flow graph 
P = the number of connected components 
 
Steps that should be followed in calculating cyclomatic complexity and test cases design are: 
 
•	Construction of graph with nodes and edges from code.
•	Identification of independent paths.
•	Cyclomatic Complexity Calculation
•	Design of Test Cases
Let a section of code as such: 
 
A = 10
   IF B > C THEN
      A = B
   ELSE
      A = C
   ENDIF
Print A
Print B
Print C

 
Control Flow Graph of above code
 
 
The cyclomatic complexity calculated for above code will be from control flow graph. The graph shows seven shapes(nodes), seven lines(edges), hence cyclomatic complexity is 7-7+2 = 2. 
Use of Cyclomatic Complexity: 
 
•	Determining the independent path executions thus proven to be very helpful for Developers and Testers.
•	It can make sure that every path have been tested at least once.
•	Thus help to focus more on uncovered paths.
•	Code coverage can be improved.
•	Risk associated with program can be evaluated.
•	These metrics being used earlier in the program helps in reducing the risks.
Advantages of Cyclomatic Complexity:.
•	It can be used as a quality metric, gives relative complexity of various designs.
•	It is able to compute faster than the Halstead’s metrics.
•	It is used to measure the minimum effort and best areas of concentration for testing.
•	It is able to guide the testing process.
•	It is easy to apply.
Disadvantages of Cyclomatic Complexity:
•	It is the measure of the programs’s control complexity and not the data the data complexity.
•	In this, nested conditional structures are harder to understand than non-nested structures.
•	In case of simple comparisons and decision strucures, it may give a misleading figure.

Dependency Injection	(GITHUB) (testset)

Dependency injection nedir, dependency Injection nedir
https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/ioc/dependency-injection
In the previous chapter, related to DIP, we created and used abstraction to make the classes loosely coupled. Here, we are going to implement Dependency Injection and strategy pattern together to move the dependency object creation completely out of the class. This is our third step in making the classes completely loose coupled.
 
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to implement IoC. It allows the creation of dependent objects outside of a class and provides those objects to a class through different ways. Using DI, we move the creation and binding of the dependent objects outside of the class that depends on them.
The Dependency Injection pattern involves 3 types of classes.
1.	Client Class: The client class (dependent class) is a class which depends on the service class
2.	Service Class: The service class (dependency) is a class that provides service to the client class.
3.	Injector Class: The injector class injects the service class object into the client class.
The following figure illustrates the relationship between these classes:
 
Dependency Injection
As you can see, the injector class creates an object of the service class, and injects that object to a client object. In this way, the DI pattern separates the responsibility of creating an object of the service class out of the client class.
Types of Dependency Injection
As you have seen above, the injector class injects the service (dependency) to the client (dependent). The injector class injects dependencies broadly in three ways: through a constructor, through a property, or through a method.
Constructor Injection: In the constructor injection, the injector supplies the service (dependency) through the client class constructor.
Property Injection: In the property injection (aka the Setter Injection), the injector supplies the dependency through a public property of the client class.
Method Injection: In this type of injection, the client class implements an interface which declares the method(s) to supply the dependency and the injector uses this interface to supply the dependency to the client class.
Let's take an example from the previous chapter to maintain the continuity. In the previous section of DIP, we used Factory class inside the CustomerBusinessLogic class to get an object of the CustomerDataAccess object, as shown below.
public interface ICustomerDataAccess
{
    string GetCustomerName(int id);
}

public class CustomerDataAccess: ICustomerDataAccess
{
    public CustomerDataAccess() {
    }

    public string GetCustomerName(int id) {
        return "Dummy Customer Name"; 
    }
}

public class DataAccessFactory
{
    public static ICustomerDataAccess GetCustomerDataAccessObj() 
    {
        return new CustomerDataAccess();
    }
}

public class CustomerBusinessLogic
{
    ICustomerDataAccess _custDataAccess;

    public CustomerBusinessLogic()
    {
        _custDataAccess = DataAccessFactory.GetCustomerDataAccessObj();
    }

    public string GetCustomerName(int id)
    {
        return _custDataAccess.GetCustomerName(id);
    }
}
The problem with the above example is that we used DataAccessFactory inside the CustomerBusinessLogic class. So, suppose there is another implementation of ICustomerDataAccess and we want to use that new class inside CustomerBusinessLogic. Then, we need to change the source code of the CustomerBusinessLogic class as well. The Dependency injection pattern solves this problem by injecting dependent objects via a constructor, a property, or an interface.
The following figure illustrates the DI pattern implementation for the above example.
 
Dependency Injection
As you see, the CustomerService class becomes the injector class, which sets an object of the service class (CustomerDataAccess) to the client class (CustomerBusinessLogic) either through a constructor, a property, or a method to achieve loose coupling. Let's explore each of these options.

-
Constructor Injection
As mentioned before, when we provide the dependency through the constructor, this is called a constructor injection.
Consider the following example where we have implemented DI using the constructor.

public class CustomerBusinessLogic
{
    ICustomerDataAccess _dataAccess;

    public CustomerBusinessLogic(ICustomerDataAccess custDataAccess)
    {
        _dataAccess = custDataAccess;
    }

    public CustomerBusinessLogic()
    {
        _dataAccess = new CustomerDataAccess();
    }

    public string ProcessCustomerData(int id)
    {
        return _dataAccess.GetCustomerName(id);
    }
}

public interface ICustomerDataAccess
{
    string GetCustomerName(int id);
}

public class CustomerDataAccess: ICustomerDataAccess
{
    public CustomerDataAccess()
    {
    }

    public string GetCustomerName(int id) 
    {
        //get the customer name from the db in real application        
        return "Dummy Customer Name"; 
    }
}
In the above example, CustomerBusinessLogic includes the constructor with one parameter of type ICustomerDataAccess. Now, the calling class must inject an object of ICustomerDataAccess.
public class CustomerService
{
    CustomerBusinessLogic _customerBL;

    public CustomerService()
    {
        _customerBL = new CustomerBusinessLogic(new CustomerDataAccess());
    }

    public string GetCustomerName(int id) {
        return _customerBL.ProcessCustomerData(id);
    }
}
As you can see in the above example, the CustomerService class creates and injects the CustomerDataAccess object into the CustomerBusinessLogic class. Thus, the CustomerBusinessLogic class doesn't need to create an object of CustomerDataAccess using the new keyword or using factory class. The calling class (CustomerService) creates and sets the appropriate DataAccess class to the CustomerBusinessLogic class. In this way, the CustomerBusinessLogic and CustomerDataAccess classes become "more" loosely coupled classes.
Property Injection
In the property injection, the dependency is provided through a public property. Consider the following example.
Example: Property Injection - C#
 Copy
public class CustomerBusinessLogic
{
    public CustomerBusinessLogic()
    {
    }

    public string GetCustomerName(int id)
    {
        return DataAccess.GetCustomerName(id);
    }

    public ICustomerDataAccess DataAccess { get; set; }
}

public class CustomerService
{
    CustomerBusinessLogic _customerBL;

    public CustomerService()
    {
        _customerBL = new CustomerBusinessLogic();
        _customerBL.DataAccess = new CustomerDataAccess();
    }

    public string GetCustomerName(int id) {
        return _customerBL.GetCustomerName(id);
    }
}
As you can see above, the CustomerBusinessLogic class includes the public property named DataAccess, where you can set an instance of a class that implements ICustomerDataAccess. So, CustomerService class creates and sets CustomerDataAccess class using this public property.
Method Injection
In the method injection, dependencies are provided through methods. This method can be a class method or an interface method.
The following example demonstrates the method injection using an interface based method.
Example: Interface Injection - C#
 Copy
interface IDataAccessDependency
{
    void SetDependency(ICustomerDataAccess customerDataAccess);
}

public class CustomerBusinessLogic : IDataAccessDependency
{
    ICustomerDataAccess _dataAccess;

    public CustomerBusinessLogic()
    {
    }

    public string GetCustomerName(int id)
    {
        return _dataAccess.GetCustomerName(id);
    }
        
    public void SetDependency(ICustomerDataAccess customerDataAccess)
    {
        _dataAccess = customerDataAccess;
    }
}

public class CustomerService
{
    CustomerBusinessLogic _customerBL;

    public CustomerService()
    {
        _customerBL = new CustomerBusinessLogic();
        ((IDataAccessDependency)_customerBL).SetDependency(new CustomerDataAccess());
    }

    public string GetCustomerName(int id) {
        return _customerBL.GetCustomerName(id);
    }
}
In the above example, the CustomerBusinessLogic class implements the IDataAccessDependency interface, which includes the SetDependency() mehtod. So, the injector class CustomerService will now use this method to inject the dependent class (CustomerDataAccess) to the client class.
Thus, you can use DI and strategy pattern to create loose coupled classes.
So far, we have used several principles and patterns to achieve loosely coupled classes. In professional projects, there are many dependent classes and implementing these patterns is time consuming. Here the IoC Container (aka the DI container) helps us. Learn about the IoC Container in the next chapter.
Learn more about the IoC and Dependency Injection here.

IoC container	(GITHUB) (testset)
Container nedir, IoC container nedir, unity container nedir, unity nedir, inversion of control nedir, dependency injection nedir
Unity Container: Register and Resolve
In the previous section, we installed Unity framework in our console project. Here, we will learn how to register type-mapping and resolve it using the unity container.
As we learned in the IoC container chapter, every container must provide a way to register and resolve dependencies. Unity container provides the RegisterType() and Resolve() methods for this.
We are going to use the following sample classes to demo the registration and resolution of dependencies throughout this chapter.
Example: C#
 Copy
public interface ICar
{
    int Run();
}

public class BMW : ICar
{
    private int _miles = 0;

    public int Run()
    {
        return ++_miles;
    }
}

public class Ford : ICar
{
    private int _miles = 0;

    public int Run()
    {
        return ++_miles;
    }
}

public class Audi : ICar
{
    private int _miles = 0;

    public int Run()
    {
        return ++_miles;
    }

}
public class Driver
{
    private ICar _car = null;

    public Driver(ICar car)
    {
        _car = car;
    }

    public void RunCar()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Running {0} - {1} mile ", _car.GetType().Name, _car.Run());
    }
}
As you can see in the sample classes, the Driver class depends on the ICar interface. So, when we instantiate the Driver class object, then we will have to pass an instance of a class which implements the ICar interface, such as the BMW, Audi or Ford class as shown below.
Example: C#
 Copy
Driver driver = new Driver(new BMW());

driver.RunCar();
Output:
Running BMW - 1 mile
In the above example, we created and passed an object of BMW while creating an object of the Driver class. Thus, we injected the dependency of the Driver class manually. Now, we will use Unity container to understand different ways to register and resolve dependencies.
Using UnityContainer
In order to use Unity container, we first need to create an object of it. You can use any class which implements the IUnityContainer interface. Unity container includes the UnityContainer class in the Microsoft.Practices.Unity namespace that implements the IUnityContainer interface. If you need to extend the container, then you can create your own custom class and implement the IUnityContainer interface as per your need.
Example: Instantiate UnityContainer - C#
 Copy
using Microsoft.Practices.Unity;

IUnityContainer container = new UnityContainer();
//or
var container = new UnityContainer();
Next, we need to register type-mapping.
Register
Before Unity resolves the dependencies, we need to register the type-mapping with the container, so that it can create the correct object for the given type. Use the RegisterType() method to register a type mapping. Basically, it configures which class to instantiate for which interface or base class. For example, if we want Unity container to create and supply an object of the BMW class whenever it needs to supply a dependency of the ICar interface, then we first need to register it as shown below.
Example: Register Type with Unity - C#
 Copy
IUnityContainer container = new UnityContainer();

container.RegisterType<ICar, BMW>();
Here, container.RegisterType<ICar, BMW>() requests Unity to create an object of the BMW class and inject it through a constructor whenever you need to inject an object of ICar.
The RegisterType method includes many overloads. Learn about all the overloads of RegisterType on MSDN.
So now, after registration, we can use the Resolve() method.
Resolve
Unity creates an object of the specified class and automatically injects the dependencies using the resolve() method. We have registered BMW with ICar above. Now, we can instantiate the Driver class using Unity container without using the new keyword as shown below.
Example: Resolve - C#
 Copy
IUnityContainer container = new UnityContainer();
container.RegisterType<ICar, BMW>();// Map ICar with BMW 

//Resolves dependencies and returns the Driver object 
Driver drv = container.Resolve<Driver>(); 
drv.RunCar();
Output:
Running BMW - 1 mile
In the above example, Unity container creates an object of the Driver class using the container.Resolve<driver>() method. The Driver class is a dependency of ICar. So, container.Resolve<Driver>() returns an object of the Driver class by automatically creating and injecting a BMW object in it. All this is behind the scene. The BMW object is created and injected because we register the BMW type with ICar.
Unity container will create a new object and inject it every time we resolve the same type.
var container = new UnityContainer();
container.RegisterType<ICar, BMW>();

Driver driver1 = container.Resolve<Driver>();
driver1.RunCar();

Driver driver2 = container.Resolve<Driver>();
driver2.RunCar();
Output:
Running BMW - 1 mile
Running BMW - 1 mile
In the above example, container injects the BMW object whenever it resolves the Driver class, e.g. driver1 and driver2 both have references to separate BMW objects.
Thus, you can create an object of the specified type using Unity container. Learn about all the overloads of the Resolve method on MSDN.
Multiple Registration
Unity container will inject the last registered type if you register multiple mappings of the same type.
IUnityContainer container = new UnityContainer();
container.RegisterType<ICar, BMW>();
container.RegisterType<ICar, Audi>();

Driver driver = container.Resolve<Driver>();
driver.RunCar();
Output:
Running Audi - 1 Mile
In the above example, ICar is mapped to both BMW and Audi. However, Unity will inject Audi every time because it has been registered last.
Register Named Type
You can register a type-mapping with a name which you can use with the Resolve() method.
Example: Register Named Type - C#
 Copy
IUnityContainer container = new UnityContainer();
container.RegisterType<ICar, BMW>();
container.RegisterType<ICar, Audi>("LuxuryCar");

ICar bmw = container.Resolve<ICar>();  // returns the BMW object
ICar audi = container.Resolve<ICar>("LuxuryCar"); // returns the Audi object
As you can see above, we have mapped ICar with both the BMW and the Audi class. However, we have given the name "LuxuryCar" to the ICar-Audi mapping. So now, the Resolve() method will return an object of Audi if we specify the mapping name.
Consider the following example:
var container = new UnityContainer();
container.RegisterType<ICar, BMW>();
container.RegisterType<ICar, Audi>("LuxuryCar");

// Registers Driver type            
container.RegisterType<Driver>("LuxuryCarDriver", 
                new InjectionConstructor(container.Resolve<ICar>("LuxuryCar")));

Driver driver1 = container.Resolve<Driver>();// injects BMW
driver1.RunCar();

Driver driver2 = container.Resolve<Driver>("LuxuryCarDriver");// injects Audi
driver2.RunCar();
Output:
Running BMW - 1 Mile
Running Audi - 1 Mile
In the above example, we registered the Driver class with the name "LuxuryCarDriver" and specified an object of InjectionConstructor. The new InjectionConstructor(container.Resolve<ICar>("LuxuryCar")) specifies a construction injection for the Driver class, which passes an object of Audi because container.Resolve("LuxuryCar") returns an Audi object. So now, we can use container.Resolve<Driver>("LuxuryCarDriver") to resolve the Driver with Audi even if ICar is registered with BMW by default.
Register Instance
Unity container allows us to register an existing instance using the RegisterInstance() method. It will not create a new instance for the registered type and we will use the same instance every time.
var container = new UnityContainer();
ICar audi = new Audi();
container.RegisterInstance<ICar>(audi);

Driver driver1 = container.Resolve<Driver>();
driver1.RunCar();
driver1.RunCar();

Driver driver2 = container.Resolve<Driver>();
driver2.RunCar();
Output:
Running Audi - 1 Mile
Running Audi - 2 Mile
Running Audi - 3 Mile
Thus, we can register and resolve different types using Unity container.

Reflection nedir	(GITHUB) (testset)

Reflection in C# is used to retrieve metadata on types at runtime. In other words, you can use reflection to inspect metadata of the types in your program dynamically -- you can retrieve information on the loaded assemblies and the types defined in them. Reflection in C# is similar to RTTI (Runtime Type Information) of C++.

To work with reflection in .Net, you should include the System.Reflection namespace in your program. In using reflection, you get objects of the type "Type" that can be used to represent assemblies, types, or modules. You can use reflection to create an instance of a type dynamically and even invoke methods of the type.

The types defined in the System.Reflection namespace include the following.

Tutorial: Using Entity Framework Core as an In-Memory Database for ASP.NET Core (GITHUB)

One of the most exciting features in the new version of Entity Framework (Entity Framework Core 1.0) is the addition of an in-memory data provider. This makes it possible to prototype applications and write tests without having to set up a local or external database. When you’re ready to switch to using a real database, you can simply swap in your actual provider.
In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to set up the Entity Framework Core InMemory provider and use it to prototype a simple ASP.NET Core API. If you’ve never set up ASP.NET Core before, follow my earlier tutorial on creating a new ASP.NET Core project to create a new API application called PrototypeApi.
Setting up Entity Framework Core
First, add the Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory package to your project. In Visual Studio, you can use the NuGet Package Manager to do this (right-click on the project and choose Manage NuGet Packages). Alternatively, you can edit the project.json file and add this line to the dependencies section:
 
1
2	"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory": "1.0.0"
Use dotnet restore to install the package if you aren’t using Visual Studio.
The API I’ll be demonstrating contains a collection of users and a collection of posts. Create some model classes to represent these entities (in a new folder called DbModels):
DbModels/User.cs

namespace PrototypeApi.DbModels
{
    public class User
    {
        public string Id { get; set; }
 
        public string FirstName { get; set; }
 
        public string LastName { get; set; }
 
        public List<Post> Posts { get; set; }
    }
}
DbModels/Post.cs

namespace PrototypeApi.DbModels
{
    public class Post
    {
        public string Id { get; set; }
 
        public string UserId { get; set; }
 
        public User User { get; set; }
 
        public string Content { get; set; }
    }
}
These simple classes will represent the data that will be saved and loaded from the database.
In this data model, there’s a straightforward one-to-many relationship between Users and Posts: a Post is “owned” by a User, and a User may have many Posts. The Posts and User properties will be automatically discovered and populated by Entity Framework Core.
You’ll also need to create a DbContext that represents the connection to the database:
ApiContext.cs

using PrototypeApi.DbModels;
 
namespace PrototypeApi
{
    public class ApiContext : DbContext
    {
        public ApiContext(DbContextOptions<ApiContext> options)
            : base(options)
        {
        }
 
        public DbSet<User> Users { get; set; }
 
        public DbSet<Post> Posts { get; set; }
    }
}
You’re all set to connect this database context to your application using the in-memory data provider. In your Startup class’ ConfigureServices method, add a new line:
 
1
2
3
4
5
6
7	public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddDbContext<ApiContext>(opt => opt.UseInMemoryDatabase());
 
    services.AddMvc();
}
At the top of the Startup class, add this line:
 
1
2	using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
Seeding With Test Data on Startup
To add data to the in-memory database when the application starts up, add some code to the Configure method:
 
1
2

{
    loggerFactory.AddConsole(Configuration.GetSection("Logging"));
    loggerFactory.AddDebug();
 
    var context = app.ApplicationServices.GetService<ApiContext>();
    AddTestData(context);
 
    app.UseMvc();
}
The new AddTestData method looks like this:

23	private static void AddTestData(ApiContext context)
{
    var testUser1 = new DbModels.User
    {
        Id = "abc123",
        FirstName = "Luke",
        LastName = "Skywalker"
    };
 
    context.Users.Add(testUser1);
 
    var testPost1 = new DbModels.Post
    {
        Id = "def234",
        UserId = testUser1.Id,
        Content = "What a piece of junk!"
    };
 
    context.Posts.Add(testPost1);
 
    context.SaveChanges();
}
Retrieving the Data
Querying and retrieving data from an in-memory provider use the same methods as any Entity Framework Core provider. To demonstrate retrieving the Users and Posts stored in the prototype database, create a simple controller:
Controllers/UsersController.cs

31
32
33
34
35	using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
 
namespace PrototypeApi.Controllers
{
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    public class UsersController : Controller
    {
        private readonly ApiContext _context;
 
        public UsersController(ApiContext context)
        {
            _context = context;
        }
 
        public async Task<IActionResult> Get()
        {
            var users = await _context.Users
                .Include(u => u.Posts)
                .ToArrayAsync();
 
            var response = users.Select(u => new
            {
                firstName = u.FirstName,
                lastName = u.LastName,
                posts = u.Posts.Select(p => p.Content)
            });
 
            return Ok(response);
        }
    }
}
This does two things: it requests an ApiContext object from the dependency injection service (using constructor injection) and exposes an HTTP GET route that returns all the users (and their posts) currently stored in the database.
In the Get method, the Include method explicitly tells Entity Framework Core to load the User’s Posts along with their other details. Entity Framework Core is smart enough to understand that the UserId field on the Post model represents a foreign key relationship between Users and Posts.
After the users and posts are asynchronously retrieved from the database, the array is projected (using Select) into a response model that includes only the fields you need in the response. This keeps the JSON response minimal.

The try..catch..finally block in .NET allows developers to handle runtime exceptions. The syntax has three variations, try..catch, try..finally, and try..catch..finally. Learn more here: Exception Handling in C#
 
The code example shows a try catch finally block syntax. 
1.	try  
2.	{  
3.	//Put suspected code here. When an exception occurs, the control will move to the catch block
4.	}  
5.	catch  
6.	{  
7.	//Catch the exception  
8.	}  
9.	finally  
10.	{  
11.	//this block of code will always get executed whether an  
12.	// exception occurs or not as long as there are no exceptions  
13.	// within this block itself. If an Exception is thrown here  
14.	// some outer try block should handle it  
15.	//Any Clean up code goes here. Especially to release any  
16.	//system resources such as file handles and network  
17.	//connections  
18.	}  
Let's go through an example so that we can better understand the purpose of the finally block. The following code illustrates the use of the finally block to clean up file states. 
1.	namespace TestFinally  
2.	{  
3.	using System;  
4.	using System.IO;  
5.	/// <summary>  
6.	/// Summary description for TestFinally.

24.	sw1 = new StreamWriter(File.Open("Test2.txt",  
25.	System.IO.FileMode.Append,  
26.	FileAccess.Write));  
27.	while (sr1.Peek() != -1)  
28.	{  
29.	sw1.WriteLine(sr1.ReadLine());  
30.	}  
31.	goto MyLabel;  
32.	}  
33.	catch (Exception e)  
34.	{  
35.	Console.WriteLine(String.Concat(e.Message,  
36.	e.StackTrace));  
37.	}

55.	sr1.Close();  
56.	}  
57.	if (sw1 != null)  
58.	{  
59.	sw1.Close();  
60.	}

62.	MyLabel:  
63.	Console.WriteLine("In Mylabel");  
64.	// note: the following statements are not allowed  
65.	//inside a finally block:  
66.	//return, goto, break and continue  
67.	Console.ReadLine();  
68.	}  
69.	}  
70.	}  
In the above code, inside the Main method, we opened two files. First we opened the Test1.txt using a StreamReader object by passing a FileStream object returned by the File.Open method, and then we opened Test2.txt through a StreamWriter object by passing a FileStream object returned by the File.Open method. The intention here is to copy lines of Test1.txt and append them to Test2.txt. If the code in the try block executes successfully, we want to close StreamReader sr1 and StreamWriter sw1 so that system resources associated with the reader/writer are released.
 
If Test1.txt opens successfully but for some reason there is an exception thrown while opening Test2.txt, we still want to close the stream associated with Test1.txt. So in this example we have added the close methods in the finally code block so that they can be positively executed. We are checking for a null value because if none of the files is opened, we would get a nulldereferencing exception in the finally block.

Jagged Array (GITHUB)
A jagged array is an array of arrays.
 



Let us understand jagged array with an example
1. There are 3 employees - Mark, Matt, John
2. Mark has a bachelor, master and doctorate degree (3 qualifications)
3. Matt has only a bachelor degree (1 qualification)
4. John has a bachelor and a master degree (2 qualifications)

Different employees have different number of qualifications. To store their qualifications in a data structure, Jagged array is one of the choices.

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        // Create a string array to store the names of the employees
        string[] employeeNames = new string[3];
        employeeNames[0] = "Mark";
        employeeNames[1] = "Matt";
        employeeNames[2] = "John";

        // Create a jagged array. As we want to store varying number of qualifications 
        // and as qualifications are strings, let's create an array of string arrays.
        string[][] jaggedArray = new string[3][];

        // Set the size of the first string array to 3, as we want to store 3 qualifications for Mark
        jaggedArray[0] = new string[3];
        // Set the size of the second string array to 1, as we want to store 
        // only 1 qualification for Matt
        jaggedArray[1] = new string[1];
        // Set the size of the third string array to 2, as we want to store 2 qualifications for John
        jaggedArray[2] = new string[2];

        // Set the values for the first string array
        jaggedArray[0][0] = "Bachelor";
        jaggedArray[0][1] = "Master";
        jaggedArray[0][2] = "Doctorate";
        // Set the values for the second string array
        jaggedArray[1][0] = "Bachelor";
        // Set the values for the thrid string array
        jaggedArray[2][0] = "Bachelor";
        jaggedArray[2][1] = "Master";

        // Loop thru and print out the elements of Jagged array
        for (int i = 0; i < jaggedArray.Length; i++)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(employeeNames[i]);
            Console.WriteLine("--------");
            string[] innerArray = jaggedArray[i];
            for (int j = 0; j < innerArray.Length; j++)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(innerArray[j]);
            }
            Console.WriteLine();
        }
    }
}

In this example, we have created an array of string arrays. In a similar way, we create an array of integer arrays, an array of decimal arrays etc.

What are the default access modifiers in C#? (GITHUB)

Access’ler mini
Kısaca:
top level class: internal
method: private
members (unless an interface or enum): private (including nested classes)
members (of interface or enum): public
constructor: private (note that if no constructor is explicitly defined, a public default constructor will be automatically defined)
delegate: internal
interface: internal
explicitly implemented interface member: public!

Short answer: minimum possible access (cf Jon Skeet's answer).
Long answer:
Non-nested types, enumeration and delegate accessibilities (may only have internal or public accessibility)
                     | Default   | Permitted declared accessibilities
------------------------------------------------------------------
namespace            | public    | none (always implicitly public)

enum                 | public    | public, internal

interface            | internal  | public, internal

class                | internal  | public, internal

struct               | internal  | public, internal

delegate             | internal  | public, internal
Nested type and member accessiblities
                     | Default   | Permitted declared accessibilities
------------------------------------------------------------------
namespace            | public    | none (always implicitly public)

enum                 | public    | All¹

interface            | public    | All¹

class                | private   | All¹

struct               | private   | public, internal, private²

delegate             | private   | All¹

constructor          | private   | All¹

enum member          | public    | none (always implicitly public)

interface member     | public    | none (always implicitly public)
     
method               | private   | All¹

field                | private   | All¹

user-defined operator| none      | public (must be declared public)
¹ All === public, protected, internal, private, protected internal
² structs cannot inherit from structs or classes (although they can, interfaces), hence protected is not a valid modifier
The accessibility of a nested type depends on its accessibility domain, which is determined by both the declared accessibility of the member and the accessibility domain of the immediately containing type. However, the accessibility domain of a nested type cannot exceed that of the containing type.
Note: CIL also has the provision for protected and internal (as opposed to the existing protected "or" internal), but to my knowledge this is not currently available for use in C#.
-
Jon Skeet yazısı:
The default access for everything in C# is "the most restricted access you could declare for that member".
So for example:
namespace MyCompany
{
    class Outer
    {
        void Foo() {}
        class Inner {}
    }
}
is equivalent to
namespace MyCompany
{
    internal class Outer
    {
        private void Foo() {}
        private class Inner {}
    }
}
The one sort of exception to this is making one part of a property (usually the setter) more restricted than the declared accessibility of the property itself:
public string Name
{
    get { ... }
    private set { ... } // This isn't the default, have to do it explicitly
}

Business Object	(BSS)	      (BSS)    
Business Object nedir
Business Object: A type of an intelligible entity being an actor inside the business layer in an n-layered architecture of object-oriented computer programs. Whereas a program may implement classes, which typically end in objects managing or executing behaviors, a business object usually does nothing itself but holds a set of instance variables or properties, also known as attributes, and associations with other business objects, weaving a map of objects representing the business relationships.
(galiba business layer’ın çalışma mantığından akılda tutulsa yanlışlık yapılmış olmaz… Business layer neydi, database layer ile presentation layer arasında görev yapan bi aracıydı. Yani iki layer arasında bişeyler yapıyordu. Şu durumda, business layer’da iş gören bi objenin business objesi olması için napabilmesi gerek; diğer layer’larla ilişkili olması gerek. Business object de galiba bu ilişkileri sağlayabilen, bi class’ın objesi… Kaynak gösterilmeli.)

C# - Dynamic Types	(GITHUB)	      (BSS)    
Viewbag nedir, viewbag kullanmalı mıyız
(not: viewbag da dynamic type’dır. Compile-time’da derlenmez. Runtime’da olur olay. O yüzden yazdığın viewbag’da hata falan varsa compile time’da göremezsin. Ve örneğin yazdığın viewbag’ın adı, view kısmında farklı controller kısmında farklı olabilir, bu hata oluşacak demektir. İsmi yanlış yazdığımz halda yine compile time’da hata gösterilmeyeceği için sıkıntı yaşayacağız demektir.
O halde view’a veri yollarken viewbag kullanmamak iyi olur diyor kudvenkat. Peki ne yapacağız? Veri yollarken strongly typed modeller kullanacağız ki bir hata oluşmuşsa compile time’da bu hatayı görebilelim. Yani viewModel kullanacağız. Viewmodel bir strongly typed model’dir çünkü oluşan hataları compile time’da gösterir.)
 
C# 4.0 (.NET 4.5) introduced a new type called dynamic that avoids compile-time type checking. A dynamic type escapes type checking at compile-time; instead, it resolves type at run time.
A dynamic type variables are defined using the dynamic keyword.
Example: dynamic Variable
dynamic MyDynamicVar = 1;
The compiler compiles dynamic types into object types in most cases. However, the actual type of a dynamic type variable would be resolved at run-time.
Example: dynamic Type at run-time
dynamic MyDynamicVar = 1;

Console.WriteLine(MyDynamicVar.GetType());
Output:
System.Int32
Dynamic types change types at run-time based on the assigned value. The following example shows how a dynamic variable changes type based on assigned value.
Example: dynamic
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    dynamic MyDynamicVar = 100;
    Console.WriteLine("Value: {0}, Type: {1}", MyDynamicVar, MyDynamicVar.GetType());

    MyDynamicVar = "Hello World!!";
    Console.WriteLine("Value: {0}, Type: {1}", MyDynamicVar, MyDynamicVar.GetType());

    MyDynamicVar = true;
    Console.WriteLine("Value: {0}, Type: {1}", MyDynamicVar, MyDynamicVar.GetType());

    MyDynamicVar = DateTime.Now;
    Console.WriteLine("Value: {0}, Type: {1}", MyDynamicVar, MyDynamicVar.GetType());
}
Try it
Output:
Value: 100, Type: System.Int32
Value: Hello World!!, Type: System.String
Value: True, Type: System.Boolean
Value: 01-01-2014, Type: System.DateTime
The dynamic type variables is converted to other types implicitly.
Example: dynamic Type Conversion
dynamic d1 = 100;
int i = d1;
		
d1 = "Hello";
string greet = d1;
		
d1 = DateTime.Now;
DateTime dt = d1;
Methods and Parameters
If you assign a class object to the dynamic type, then the compiler would not check for correct methods and properties name of a dynamic type that holds the custom class object. Consider the following example.
Example: Calling Methods
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        dynamic stud = new Student();

        stud.DisplayStudentInfo(1, "Bill");// run-time error, no compile-time error
        stud.DisplayStudentInfo("1");// run-time error, no compile-time error
        stud.FakeMethod();// run-time error, no compile-time error
    }
}

public class Student
{
    public void DisplayStudentInfo(int id)
    {
    }
}
Try it
In the above example, the C# compiler does not check for the number of parameters, parameters type, or non-existent. It validates these things at run-time, and if it is not valid, then throws a run-time exception. Note that Visual Studio IntelliSense is not supported for the dynamic types. Note that Visual Studio IntelliSense is not supported for the dynamic types.
The dynamic language runtime (DLR) API provides the infrastructure that supports the dynamic type in C#. For more information about the DLR, visit Dynamic Language Runtime Overview.

Domain Class,  Domain Object    	(GITHUB)	      (BSS)
Domain class nedir, domain object nedir, business class nedir, business object nedir

A "domain" class is one that models your data. It is typically used to map data from your data store (e.g. a database) to an in-memory object. A business class is one that your application works with. It can be the same as the domain class, and usually performs some sort of business logic or processing.
Persistence refers to the ability of the object state to be saved to some data store (e.g. xml, a text file, or more commonly, a database). So the state of this kind of object "persists" whether the application is running or not.
(business class ile domain class arasında fark yok diyor->) To me, there is no difference with a business class: a business object doesn't perform more or less business logic than a domain object (a domain model where business logic is implemented outside the domain objects is called an Anemic Domain Model, which is a pejorative term), domain objects and business objects are the same thing.

Using a mapping tool such as AutoMapper will do the mapping of the domain object to the Entity object, or you can code that separately if desired.

Learn Entity Framework Code First in 10 Minutes
Entity Framework is Microsoft’s ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework for data access. Entity Framework initially supported Model First and Database First approach where domain object models are defined in a XML based edmx files. Entity Framework Code First is another approach released with Entity Framework 4.1 version. 
As the name suggests, in Code First approach we can define domain model class first and then the Code First framework will create the database on the fly based on the domain model class definition. In other words, designing the domain model classes first and then creating database based on the domain model is called Domain Driven Design. This methodology allows developers to focus and think through in terms of business domain objects rather than creating domain model classes to match the database design in Database First approach.
Defining Domain Classes
For easy understanding, let’s build a simple model with Employee and Department to understand how Code First works.
 
public class Employee
{
    public int EmployeeId { get; set; }
    public int DepartmentId { get; set; }
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public string Address1 { get; set; }
    public string Address2 { get; set; }
    public string City { get; set; }
    public string State { get; set; }
    public string Country { get; set; }
    public string PostalCode { get; set; }
}

public class Department
{
    public int DepartmentId { get; set; }
    public string DepartmentName { get; set; }
}
 
 
These classes are nothing but a plain C# class or to simply put they are POCO class which represents our domain in our project. We can now start using this C# classes as our code first model and begin writing our data access logic. These classes does not even have any configurations or setting that are related to Entity Framework or Code First paradigm or any other data access settings. This flexibility of the Code First helps us to even migrate an existing domain model classes to Code First easily. Code First also releives developers who are forced to create domain objects to match the database schema all these days.
Next, let’s see how to let Code First know about these domain classes to manage the database creation and data access.
Managing Domain Objects with Code First
Entity Framework expose a class called DbContext for doing this. We just need to define a class that inherits System.Data.Entity.DbContext class and expose these domain objects as property member of this class through System.Data.Entity.DbSet<T> object. The DbSet object represents the collection of our entity that are persisted in the database by the DbContext object. It also gives the querying capabilities to the entity collection or the underlying table.
 
public class DBModel : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Department> Departments { get; set; }
    public DbSet<Employee> Employees { get; set; }
}
 
 
Querying Using DBModel and Entity
Querying is similar to what we do with Entity Framework data access which uses LINQ construct. Let’s add some default rows into Employee and Department table now.
 
DBModel db = new DBModel();
if (db.Departments.Count() <= 0)
{
    Department department = new Department();
    department.DepartmentName = "IT";
    db.Departments.Add(department);
    department = new Department();
    department.DepartmentName = "CSE";
    db.Departments.Add(department);
}
if (db.Employees.Count() <= 0)
{
    Employee emp = new Employee();
    emp.FirstName = "Tom";
    emp.LastName = "Hanks";
    emp.Address1 = "1St Street";
    emp.Address2 = "Columbia Ave";
    emp.City = "Los Angeles";
    emp.State = "CA";
    emp.Country = "US";
    emp.PostalCode = "123456";
    emp.DepartmentId = 1;
    db.Employees.Add(emp);

    emp = new Employee();
    emp.FirstName = "Bruce";
    emp.LastName = "Willis";
    emp.Address1 = "2nd Street";
    emp.Address2 = "Farmers Ave";
    emp.City = "Seattle";
    emp.State = "WA";
    emp.Country = "US";
    emp.PostalCode = "756446";
    emp.DepartmentId = 2;
    db.Employees.Add(emp);

    emp = new Employee();
    emp.FirstName = "Johnny";
    emp.LastName = "Depp";
    emp.Address1 = "5Th Street";
    emp.Address2 = "Shuttle Ave";
    emp.City = "San Antonio";
    emp.State = "TX";
    emp.Country = "US";
    emp.PostalCode = "123456";
    emp.DepartmentId = 2;
    db.Employees.Add(emp);
}
db.SaveChanges();
 
 

Entity Framework Code First relies heavily on conventions to manage the domain classes and database creation.
For example, a primary key field is identified and created when Code First finds a property with TypeName followed by “Id” string. This is how EmployeeId and DepartmentId are created as primary key. Code First also allows us to customize this conventions through number of configuration options.
There are primarily 2 ways to use the configurations and dictate terms to Code First. They are,
1.	By using Data Annotations
2.	By using Fluent API
Using Data Annotations 
Data annotation nedir, data annotations nedir
To make FirstName and LastName as not null columns (or mandatory in domain) we just need to decorate those property using [Required] attribute from System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations namespace.
 
public class Employee
{
    public int EmployeeId { get; set; }
    public int DepartmentId { get; set; }
    [Required]
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    [Required]
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public string Address1 { get; set; }
    public string Address2 { get; set; }
    public string City { get; set; }
    public string State { get; set; }
    public string Country { get; set; }
    public string PostalCode { get; set; }
}
 
This will make the FirstName and LastName column as not null in database. Similarly, the DataAnnotations namespace has many properties to configure Code First database model properties.
Fluent API
Instead of using Data Annotations and mixing Entity Framework constructs in domain model we can specify the configurations using Fluent API inside DbContext OnModelCreating event. This will help to keep the domain model class free from any configuration settings. The below code will help us to add the above not null configuration by using Fluent API.
 
public class DBModel : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Department> Departments { get; set; }
    public DbSet<Employee> Employees { get; set; }

    protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        modelBuilder.Entity<Employee>().Property(p => p.FirstName).IsRequired();
        modelBuilder.Entity<Employee>().Property(p => p.LastName).IsRequired();
    }
}
 
Note - There are few configurations that are available only through Fluent API and which cannot be done by Data Annotations. So, those configurations should be managed only by using Fluent API
Database Initializers and Code First Migrations
Though the above approaches creates database automatically, we can also set Database Initializers to manage database creation process.
Database.SetInitializer(new DropCreateDatabaseIfModelChanges<DBModel>());
 
Calling the above statement before using the DbContext(or DBModel) will re-create database fully if there is a change detected in the model object after it has last created.
There are other initializers like,
•	CreateDatabaseIfNotExists – To create DB if not exists and a default option.
•	DropCreateDatabaseAlways – To recreate DB always.
These Database Initializers are very basic and cannot be used in real time as our production applications are incrementally built and so the database too. Entity Framework 4.3 has introduced a strategic tool called Code First Migrations for this advanced tasks. The additional table you see dbo.__MigrationHistory in the database created by Code First is used by this framework for detecting changes and managing the migrations.

Object Model   	(GITHUB)	      (BSS)    
Object model nedir

In LINQ to SQL, an object model in your own programming language is mapped to a relational database.
An object model is a logical interface, software or system that is modeled through the use of object-oriented techniques. It enables the creation of an architectural software or system model prior to development or programming.
An object model is part of the object-oriented programming (OOP) lifecycle.
Techopedia explains Object Model
An object model helps describe or define a software/system in terms of objects and classes. It defines the interfaces or interactions between different models, inheritance, encapsulation and other object-oriented interfaces and features.

Object model examples include:

•	Document Object Model (DOM): A set of objects that provides a modeled representation of dynamic HTML and XHTML-based Web pages
•	Component Object Model (COM): A proprietary Microsoft software architecture used to create software components

Anemic Domain Model, Rich Domain Model (GITHUB)


Anemic domain model = database tables mapped to objects (only field values, no real behavior)
Rich domain model = a collection of objects that expose behavior
If you want to create a simple CRUD application, maybe an anemic model with a classic MVC framework is enough. But if you want to implement some kind of logic, anemic model means that you will not do object oriented programming.
*Note that object behavior has nothing to do with persistence. A different layer (Data Mappers, Repositories e.t.c.) is responsible for persisting domain objects.

Anemic domain model is the use of a software domain model where the domain objects contain little or no business logic (validations, calculations, business rules etc.).

N Tier(Multi-Tier), 3-Tier, 2-Tier Architecture with EXAMPLE
What is N-Tier?
An N-Tier Application program is one that is distributed among three or more separate computers in a distributed network.
The most common form of n-tier is the 3-tier Application, and it is classified into three categories.
•	User interface programming in the user's computer
•	Business logic in a more centralized computer, and
•	Required data in a computer that manages a database.
This architecture model provides Software Developers to create Reusable application/systems with maximum flexibility.
In N-tier, "N" refers to a number of tiers or layers are being used like – 2-tier, 3-tier or 4-tier, etc. It is also called “Multi-Tier Architecture”.
The n-tier architecture is an industry-proven software architecture model. It is suitable to support enterprise level client-server applications by providing solutions to scalability, security, fault tolerance, reusability, and maintainability. It helps developers to create flexible and reusable applications. 
N-Tier Architecture
A diagrammatic representation of an n-tier system depicts here – presentation, application, and database layers.
 N Tier Architecture Diagram
These three layers can be further subdivided into different sub-layers depending on the requirements.
Some of the popular sites who have applied this architecture are
•	MakeMyTrip.com
•	Sales Force enterprise application
•	Indian Railways – IRCTC
•	Amazon.com, etc.
Some common terms to remember, so as to understand the concept more clearly.
•	Distributed Network: It is a network architecture, where the components located at network computers coordinate and communicate their actions only by passing messages. It is a collection of multiple systems situated at different nodes but appears to the user as a single system.
o	It provides a single data communication network which can be managed separately by different networks.
o	An example of Distributed Network– where different clients are connected within LAN architecture on one side and on the other side they are connected to high-speed switches along with a rack of servers containing service nodes.
•	Client-Server Architecture: It is an architecture model where the client (one program) requests a service from a server (another program) i.e. It is a request-response service provided over the internet or through an intranet.
In this model, Client will serve as one set of program/code which executes a set of actions over the network. While Server, on the other hand, is a set of another program, which sends the result sets to the client system as requested.
o	In this, client computer provides an interface to an end user to request a service or a resource from a server and on the other hand server then processes the request and displays the result to the end user.
o	An example of Client-Server Model– an ATM machine. A bank is the server for processing the application within the large customer databases and ATM machine is the client having a user interface with some simple application processing.
•	Platform: In computer science or software industry, a platform is a system on which applications program can run. It consists of a combination of hardware and software that have a built-in instruction for a processors/microprocessors to perform specific operations.
o	In more simple words, the platform is a system or a base where any applications can run and execute to obtain a specific task.
o	An example of Platform – A personal machine loaded with Windows 2000 or Mac OS X as examples of 2 different platforms. (platform nedir)
•	Database: It is a collection of information in an organized way so that it can be easily accessed, managed and updated.
o	Examples of Database – MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle Database are some common Db's.
Types of N-Tier Architectures
There are different types of N-Tier Architectures, like 3-tier Architecture, 2-Tier Architecture and 1- Tier Architecture.
First, we will see 3-tier Architecture, which is very important.
3-Tier Architecture
By looking at the below diagram, you can easily identify that 3-tier architecture has three different layers.
•	Presentation layer
•	Business Logic layer
•	Database layer
 
3 Tier Architecture Diagram
Here we have taken a simple example of student form to understand all these three layers. It has information about a student like – Name, Address, Email, and Picture.
User Interface Layer or Presentation Layer
 
Presentation Layer
private void DataGrid1_SelectedIndexChanged(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
// Object of the Property layer
clsStudent objproperty=new clsStudent();
// Object of the business layer
clsStudentInfo objbs=new clsStudentInfo();
// Object of the dataset in which we receive the data sent by the business layer
DataSet ds=new DataSet();
// here we are placing the value in the property using the object of the
//property layer
objproperty.id=int.Parse(DataGridl.SelectedItem.Cells[1].Text.ToString());

// In this following code we are calling a function from the business layer and 
// passing the object of the property layer which will carry the ID till the database.
ds=objbs.GetAllStudentBsIDWise(objproperty);

// What ever the data has been returned by the above function into the dataset
//is being populate through the presentation laye.
txtId.Text=ds.Tables[0].Rows[0][0].ToString();
txtFname.Text=ds.Tables[0].Rows[0][1].ToString();
txtAddress.Text=ds.Tables[0].Rows[0][2].ToString();
txtemail.Text=ds.Tables[0].Rows[0][3].ToString();
Code Explanation
•	The above code defines the basic designing of a front end view of applications as well as calling of the functions of other layers so that they can be integrated with each other.
Business Access Layer -
This is the function of the business layer which accepts the data from the application layer and passes it to the data layer.
•	Business logic acts as an interface between Client layer and Data Access Layer
•	All business logic – like validation of data, calculations, data insertion/modification are written under business logic layer.
•	It makes communication faster and easier between the client and data layer
•	Defines a proper workflow activity that is necessary to complete a task.
// this is the function of the business layer which accepts the data from the 
//application layer and passes it to the data layer.
public class clsStudentInfo (bir business layer metodu)
{
	public DataSet GetAllStudentBsIDWise(clsStudent obj)   (application layer’dan   veri alınıyor [bkz parametreye argüman olarak] ve bu very dönülüyor.)
	{
	 DataSet ds=new DataSet();
	 ds=objdt.getdata_dtIDWise(obj);// Calling of Data layer function (burada da data layer ile ilişki kuruluyor)
	 return ds;
	}
}

Explanation of code
The code is using the function of business layer, which will accept the data for the application layer and passed it to the data layer. The Business layer codes act as a mediator between the functions defined in the presentation layer and data layer and calling the functions vice -versa.
Data Access Layer
This is the data layer function, which receives the data from the business layer and performs the necessary operation into the database.
// this is the datalayer function which is receiving the data from the business 
//layer and performing the required operation into the database

public class clsStudentData // Data layer class 
{
	// object of property layer class
	public DataSet getdata_dtIDUise(clsStudent obj)
	{
	 DataSet ds;
	 string sql;
	 sql="select * from student where Studentld=" +obj.id+ "order by Studentld;
	 ds=new DataSet();
	//this is the datalayer function which accepts the sql query and performs the 
	//corresponding operation
		ds=objdt.ExecuteSql(sql); 
		return ds;
	}
}
Explanation of code
The code defines in dataset layer above accepts the entire request: requested by the system and performing the required operations into the database.
2-Tier Architecture:
It is like Client-Server architecture, where communication takes place between client and server.
In this type of software architecture, the presentation layer or user interface layer runs on the client side while dataset layer gets executed and stored on server side.
There is no Business logic layer or immediate layer in between client and server.
Single Tier or 1-Tier Architecture:
It is the simplest one as it is equivalent to running the application on the personal computer. All of the required components for an application to run are on a single application or server.
Presentation layer, Business logic layer, and data layer are all located on a single machine.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Multi-Tier Architectures
Advantages	Disadvantages
•	Scalability	•	Increase in Effort
•	Data Integrity	•	Increase in Complexity
•	Reusability	 
•	Reduced Distribution	 
•	Improved Security	 
•	Improved Availability	 
Hence, it is a part of a program which encrypts real-world business problems and determines how data can be updated, created, stored, or changed to get the complete task done.
N-Tier Architecture Tips and Development
Considering the software professionals must have a full control on all the layers of the architecture, tips on n-tier architecture are given as below
1.	Try to decouple layers from another layer as much as possible by using a technique like soap XML.
2.	Use some automated tools to generate a mapping between a business logic layer and a relational database layer (data layer). Tools that can help in modeling these mapping techniques are – Entity Framework and Hibernate for .Net etc.
3.	In client presenter layer, put a common code for all the clients in a separate library as much as possible. This will maximize the code reusability for all types of clients.
4.	A cache layer can be added into an existing layer to speed up the performance.
Summary:
The N-tier architecture helps to manage all the components (business layer, presentation layer, and database layer) of an application under one roof.
Applications thatuses small numbers of users on a local area network can benefit from n-tier architecture.
Such architectural design ascertains maintaining, scaling up and deploying an application on the Internet efficiently.

LINQ - LINQ extension methods   	(GITHUB)	      (asd)    
linq nedir, LINQ nedir, LINQ extension method nedir, LINQ extension methods nedir
I find that if you're familiar with SQL syntax, using the LINQ query syntax is much clearer, more natural, and makes it easier to spot errors:
var id = 1;
var query =
   from post in database.Posts
   join meta in database.Post_Metas on post.ID equals meta.Post_ID
   where post.ID == id
   select new { Post = post, Meta = meta };

If you're really stuck on using lambdas though, your syntax is quite a bit off. Here's the same query, using the LINQ extension methods:
var id = 1;
var query = database.Posts    // your starting point - table in the "from" statement
   .Join(database.Post_Metas, // the source table of the inner join
      post => post.ID,        // Select the primary key (the first part of the "on" clause in an sql "join" statement)
      meta => meta.Post_ID,   // Select the foreign key (the second part of the "on" clause)
      (post, meta) => new { Post = post, Meta = meta }) // selection
   .Where(postAndMeta => postAndMeta.Post.ID == id);    // where statement

Context   	(GITHUB)	      (BSS)    
context nedir
Defines an environment for the objects that are resident inside it and for which a policy can be enforced.
-
Something is typically called a "context" in computer programming when that something encapsulates some kind of state.
In the example of Linq 2 sql or EF, you have a Data Context, or Object Context.. these encapsulate the state of your data model, including connections and versioning.
In the case of HttpContext, it's encapsulating the state of an Http connection (which is normally considered stateless, but HttpContext tries to give state to it).
In english, if we refer to context, we refer to information surrounding something that allows you to understand the entire situation in which that something exists. For example, we may say a statement is "taken out of context". That would mean a statement by itself doesn't necessarily reveal all the information.
Out of context:
People are tasty.
In Context:
We should never say or think that people are tasty.
Without the "context", the statement has a different meaning. Programming has taken the term to similarly refer to the data surrounding something that gives it more meaning.

Fluent API    	(BSS)	      (BSS)    
Data annotations nedir, fluent api nedir, fluent nedir
Fluent API is an advanced way of specifying model configuration that covers everything that data annotations can do in addition to some more advanced configuration not possible with data annotations. Data annotations and the fluent API can be used together, but Code First gives precedence to Fluent API > data annotations > default conventions.
•	Fluent API is another way to configure your domain classes.
•	The Code First Fluent API is most commonly accessed by overriding the OnModelCreating method on your derived DbContext.
•	Fluent API provides more functionality for configuration than DataAnnotations. Fluent API supports the following types of mappings.
In this chapter, we will continue with the simple example which contains Student, Course and Enrollment classes and one context class with MyContext name as shown in the following code.
using System.Data.Entity; 
using System.Linq; 
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;  

namespace EFCodeFirstDemo {

   class Program {
      static void Main(string[] args) {}
   }
   
   public enum Grade {
      A, B, C, D, F
   }

   public class Enrollment {
      public int EnrollmentID { get; set; }
      public int CourseID { get; set; }
      public int StudentID { get; set; }
      public Grade? Grade { get; set; }
		
      public virtual Course Course { get; set; }
      public virtual Student Student { get; set; }
   }

   public class Student {
      public int ID { get; set; }
      public string LastName { get; set; }
      public string FirstMidName { get; set; }
		
      public DateTime EnrollmentDate { get; set; }
		
      public virtual ICollection<Enrollment> Enrollments { get; set; }
   }

   public class Course {
      public int CourseID { get; set; }
      public string Title { get; set; }
      public int Credits { get; set; }
		
      public virtual ICollection<Enrollment> Enrollments { get; set; }
   }

   public class MyContext : DbContext {
      public virtual DbSet<Course> Courses { get; set; }
      public virtual DbSet<Enrollment> Enrollments { get; set; }
      public virtual DbSet<Student> Students { get; set; }
   }

}	  
To access Fluent API you need to override the OnModelCreating method in DbContext. Let’s take a look at a simple example in which we will rename the column name in student table from FirstMidName to FirstName as shown in the following code.
public class MyContext : DbContext {

   protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder) {
      modelBuilder.Entity<Student>().Property(s ⇒ s.FirstMidName)
      .HasColumnName("FirstName");}

      public virtual DbSet<Course> Courses { get; set; }
      public virtual DbSet<Enrollment> Enrollments { get; set; }
      public virtual DbSet<Student> Students { get; set; }
}
DbModelBuilder is used to map CLR classes to a database schema. It is the main class and on which you can configure all your domain classes. This code centric approach to building an Entity Data Model (EDM) is known as Code First.

Transient Errors Are Evil – How to Handle them With Exponential Backoff in C#	(BSS)	      (BSS)    
February 26, 2016//  by Deb Haldar//  0 Comments
      Transient errors are intermittent errors caused by a short lived outage of a specific resource or service. For example, a network route might be unavailable for a few seconds or milliseconds, a web service may be experiencing high load and sending intermittent HTTP 503-Service unavailable messages or a database you’re trying to access might be in the process of being moved to a different server and hence unavailable for a few seconds.
 
For many transient errors, it makes sense back-off and retry the current operation after waiting a few seconds. The back-off strategy employed could be one of the following:
•	Retry Immediately: Retry the failed operation immediately without waiting.
•	Retry at Fixed Intervals: Retry the failed operation after waiting a fixed amount of time. That is, the wait period between subsequent retries is fixed.
•	Retry with Exponential Back-Off: Exponentially increase the wait time between subsequent retries. Eg. Retry after waiting 2, 4, 8, 16, 32… seconds etc.
•	
Why Exponential Backoff ?
Exponential back-off is super critical when communicating with any web service or any cloud based service like Windows Azure. If the cloud service provider is already experiencing transient issues, immediate retries from multiple client code tends to further worsen the situation. Sometimes this overload of requests leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) type situation for the service. To guard against such situations, many services will throttle clients who makes too many requests within a certain span of time. Using an exponential back-off ensures that each client calling into the service code gives enough breathing room for the service to recover.
 
Some exponential back-off algorithms also adds a randomly calculated delta to the back-off time. This ensures that if many clients are using the same back-off algorithm, their retry times have a lower probability of coinciding. For example, instead of using just the raw exponential backoff time which retries at 2, 4, 8, 16 seconds etc, the formula adds a random +/- 20% delta such that the back-off might happen at 1.7, 4.2, 8.5, 15.4 seconds
So how do we Implement it Retry with Exponential Backoff ?
I’m going to show you three ways of incorporating exponential back-off in any code where retries are needed. This post will detail the use of a home grown retry logic with exponential back off that I’ve been using for a while. Subsequent posts will show how to do this via readily available libraries in a more sophisticated way. The benefit of using the home grown recipe is that you do not need to install any additional dependencies. Just copy paste the code snippet below and you’re all set.
Scenario:
We’re going to request the homepage of https://microsoft.sharepoint.com . This page requires a valid claims token – so the request I going to throw a HTTP 403 – Forbidden response. This response, while expected in this case is a nice way to simulate errors which we can retry.
Client code requirements:
We need to try the operation 3 times. The code should back off exponentially, i.e., the wait time between retries should increase exponentially. Eg. The first retry happens after 2 seconds, the second after 4 seconds, the third after 8 seconds and so on.
 
Client Code
The following code below creates the HTTP Request:
    static void ExecuteHTTPGet(string requestUri)
    {
        HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(requestUri);
        request.KeepAlive = false;
        request.Method = "GET";

        // This line will throw an exception if the HTTP GET fails
        HttpWebResponse webResponse = (HttpWebResponse)request.GetResponse();
        int requestStatus = (int)webResponse.StatusCode;
        webResponse.Close();
    }
Notice that we’re not catching any exception that might be thrown by the client. Catching the exception and retrying the operation will be delegated to our Retry logic.

Custom Retry Logic With Exponential Backoff
  // Enum representing the back-off strategy to use. Required parameter for DoActionWithRetry()
  enum BackOffStrategy
    {
        Linear = 1,
        Exponential = 2
    }

// Retry a specific codeblock wrapped in an Action delegate
static void DoActionWithRetry(Action action, int maxRetries, int waitBetweenRetrySec, BackOffStrategy retryStrategy)
    {
        if (action == null)
        {
            throw new ArgumentNullException("No action specified");
        }

        int retryCount = 1;
        while(retryCount <= maxRetries)
        {
            try
            {
                action();
                break;
            }
            catch(Exception ex)
            {
                if (maxRetries <= 0)
                {
                    throw;
                }
                else
                {
                    //Maybe Log the number of retries
                    Console.WriteLine("Encountered exception {0}, retrying operation", ex.ToString());
                        
                    TimeSpan sleepTime;
                    if(retryStrategy == BackOffStrategy.Linear)
                    {
                        //Wait time is Fixed
                        sleepTime = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(waitBetweenRetrySec);
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        //Wait time increases exponentially
                        sleepTime = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(Math.Pow(waitBetweenRetrySec, retryCount));
                    }
                        
                    Thread.Sleep(sleepTime);

                    retryCount++;
                }
            }
        } 
    }
Here we first define an enum to specify the back-off strategies available. Based on the values in this enum, we’ve structured the code inside the catch() block of DoActionWithRetry() to modify the wait time for each subsequent retry. Notice how the formula uses a combination of retryCount and the base wait time specified to calculate the exponential wait time.

  //Wait time increases exponentially
  sleepTime = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(Math.Pow(waitBetweenRetrySec, retryCount));

Putting it all together
So now that we have the operation we want to execute and a generic retry block, let’s use them in our main function:
 
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        try
        {
            DoActionWithRetry(() =>
                {
                    ExecuteHTTPGet("https://microsoft.sharepoint.com");
                }, 3, 5, BackOffStrategy.Exponential);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            //At this point you can either log the error or log the error and rethrow the exception, depending on your requirements
            Console.WriteLine("Exhausted all retries - exiting program");
            throw; 
        }

    }
The code will retry the HTTP GET request on the url for 3 times and will throw an exception if it encounters a failure the fourth time around. When the number of retries has been exhausted, it’s typically recommended to log the exception and then terminate the thread/ application.
And that’s it !!!
Stay tuned for the next post which’ll show how to do this in a fancier way

Intercept Database Command in Entity Framework (GITHUB)
Here, you will learn how to intercept database commands executed by DbContext in EF 6 database-first, as well as code-first approach.
EF 6 provides the ability to intercept the context by implementing the IDbCommandInterceptor interface. The IDbCommandInterceptor interface includes methods which intercept an instance of DbContext and allow you to execute your custom logic before or after a context executes commands or queries. The DbContext executes commands and queries using ADO.NET methods such as ExecuteNonQuery, ExecuteScalar, and ExecuteReader, which you can intercept by implementing methods such as NonQueryExecuted and NonQueryExecuting etc.
To intercept an instance of DbContext, first, create the custom class and implement IDbCommandInterceptor, as shown below:
class EFCommandInterceptor: IDbCommandInterceptor
{
    public void NonQueryExecuted(System.Data.Common.DbCommand command, DbCommandInterceptionContext<int> interceptionContext)
    {
        LogInfo("NonQueryExecuted", String.Format(" IsAsync: {0}, Command Text: {1}", interceptionContext.IsAsync, command.CommandText));
    }

    public void NonQueryExecuting(System.Data.Common.DbCommand command, DbCommandInterceptionContext<int> interceptionContext)
    {
        LogInfo("NonQueryExecuting", String.Format(" IsAsync: {0}, Command Text: {1}", interceptionContext.IsAsync,  command.CommandText));
    }

    public void ReaderExecuted(System.Data.Common.DbCommand command, DbCommandInterceptionContext<System.Data.Common.DbDataReader> interceptionContext)
    {
        LogInfo("ReaderExecuted", String.Format(" IsAsync: {0}, Command Text: {1}", interceptionContext.IsAsync, command.CommandText));
    }

    public void ReaderExecuting(System.Data.Common.DbCommand command, DbCommandInterceptionContext<System.Data.Common.DbDataReader> interceptionContext)
    {
        LogInfo("ReaderExecuting", String.Format(" IsAsync: {0}, Command Text: {1}", interceptionContext.IsAsync, command.CommandText));
    }

    public void ScalarExecuted(System.Data.Common.DbCommand command, DbCommandInterceptionContext<object> interceptionContext)
    {
        LogInfo("ScalarExecuted", String.Format(" IsAsync: {0}, Command Text: {1}", interceptionContext.IsAsync, command.CommandText));
    }

    public void ScalarExecuting(System.Data.Common.DbCommand command, DbCommandInterceptionContext<object> interceptionContext)
    {
        LogInfo("ScalarExecuting", String.Format(" IsAsync: {0}, Command Text: {1}", interceptionContext.IsAsync, command.CommandText));
    }

    private void LogInfo(string command, string commandText)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Intercepted on: {0} :- {1} ", command, commandText);
    }
}
As you can see in the above example, IDbCommandInterceptor provides six methods for implementation. It logs the command for demo purposes, but you can write your custom logic here.
Next, you will need to configure the interceptor either by using a config file or code-based configuration.
Configure the interceptor in app.config file, as shown below:
<entityFramework>
    <interceptors>
        <interceptor type="EF6DBFirstTutorials.EFCommandInterceptor, EF6DBFirstTutorials">
        </interceptor>
    </interceptors>
</entityFramework>
If you use code-based configuration, then configure it as shown below.
public class FE6CodeConfig : DbConfiguration
{
    public FE6CodeConfig()
    {
        this.AddInterceptor(new EFCommandInterceptor());
    }
}
So now, we can log commands whenever an instance DbContext executes a command or query. Consider the following example.
var newStudent =  new Student() { FirstName = "Bill" };

using (var context = new SchoolDBEntities())
{
    context.Students.Add(newStudent);
    context.SaveChanges();
}
The above example will log the following.
Output:
Intercepted on: ReaderExecuting :- IsAsync: False, Command Text: INSERT [dbo].[Student]([FirstName], [StandardId], [LastName])
VALUES (@0, NULL, NULL)
SELECT [StudentID], [RowVersion] FROM [dbo].[Student]
WHERE @@ROWCOUNT > 0 AND [StudentID] = scope_identity()
Intercepted on: ReaderExecuted :- IsAsync: False, Command Text: INSERT [dbo].[Student]([FirstName], [StandardId], [LastName])
VALUES (@0, NULL, NULL)
SELECT [StudentID], [RowVersion] FROM [dbo].[Student]
WHERE @@ROWCOUNT > 0 AND [StudentID] = scope_identity()

MULTI TENANCY - MULTI TENANT   	(GITHUB)	      (asd)    
multi tenant nedir, multi tenancy nedir, multitenant nedir, multi-tenant nedir
What are the advantages of a multi-tenancy SaaS architecture? How does it differ from single tenant instances? We break down the differences and highlight the benefits of implementing a SaaS solution for data protection in this blog.
MULTI-TENANCY – A CORE BENEFIT OF SAAS
In the early days of the cloud, organizations were reluctant to adopt cloud strategies. Few organizations considered applying policies, technologies, and controls to protect data across the cloud. The last several years, which has seen the proven effectiveness of cloud deployments in scalability, cost, and security, has changed that however. Now we’re seeing the rapid adoption of cloud platforms by organizations of all shapes and sizes.
Digital Guardian’s Data Protection Platform leverages software as a service, or SaaS, to provide data protection in a package that results in superior security, better economics, and reduced overhead. One of the ways we do this is through multi-tenant architecture.

SINGLE TENANT VS MULTI-TENANT – LEARN THE DIFFERENCE
Single Tenant – A single instance of the software and supporting infrastructure serve a single customer. With single tenancy, each customer has his or her own independent database and instance of the software. Essentially, there is no sharing happening with this option.
Potential benefits of single-tenant include:
•	Security: A single customer and a single server is often contained on secure hardware being used by a limited number of people.
•	Dependability: With an entire environment dedicated to one client, resources are abundant and available anytime.
•	Customization: Control over the entire environment allows for customization and added functionality, if desired.
Potential drawbacks of single-tenant:
•	Maintenance: Single-tenant typically means more tasks and regular maintenance to keep things running smoothly and efficiently.
•	Setup/Management: By comparison, SaaS multi-tenant environments are quick to setup and manage.
•	Cost: Single-tenant typically allows for more resources, but at a premium price given that there is only one customer for the entire environment.
Multi-Tenant – Multi-tenancy means that a single instance of the software and its supporting infrastructure serves multiple customers. Each customer shares the software application and also shares a single database. Each tenant’s data is isolated and remains invisible to other tenants.
Potential benefits of multi-tenant:
•	Affordable Cost: Multiple customers means that the cost for the environment is shared, and those savings (from the SaaS vendor) are typically transferred to the cost of the software.
•	Integrations: Cloud environments allow for easier integration with other applications through the use of APIs.
•	“Hands-free” Maintenance: The server technically belongs to the SaaS vendor, meaning that a certain level of database maintenance is handled by the vendor, instead of you maintaining the environment yourself.
Potential drawbacks of multi-tenant:
•	Limited Management/Customization: While you do have added integration benefits, custom changes to the database aren’t typically an option.
•	Security: Other tenants won’t see your data. However, multiple users (not associated with your organization) are allowed on the same database. This broader access reduces control of security.
•	Updates/Changes: If you’re reliant on integrations with other SaaS products and one updates their system, it may cause issues with those connecting apps.

BENEFITS OF SAAS MULTI-TENANT ARCHITECTURE
•	Lower costs through economies of scale: With multi-tenancy, scaling has far fewer infrastructure implications than with a single-tenancy-hosted solution because new users get access to the same basic software.
•	Shared infrastructure leads to lower costs: SaaS allows companies of all sizes to share infrastructure and data center operational costs. There is no need to add applications and more hardware to their environment. Not having to provision or manage any infrastructure or software above and beyond internal resources enables businesses to focus on everyday tasks.
•	Ongoing maintenance and updates: Customers don’t need to pay costly maintenance fees to keep their software up to date. Vendors roll out new features and updates. These are often included with a SaaS subscription.
•	Configuration can be done while leaving the underlying codebase unchanged: Single-tenant-hosted solutions are often customized, requiring changes to an application’s code. This customization can be costly and can make upgrades time-consuming because the upgrade might not be compatible with your environment.
Multi-tenant solutions are designed to be highly configurable so that businesses can make the application perform the way they want. There is no changing the code or data structure, making the upgrade process easy.
Multi-tenancy architecture also allows Digital Guardian to efficiently service everyone from small customers, whose scale may not warrant dedicated infrastructure, to large enterprises that need access to the cloud’s virtually unlimited compute resources. Software development and maintenance costs are shared, driving down expenditures, resulting in savings that are passed onto you, the customers.

Functional Programming For The Rest of Us (GITHUB)
Functional programming nedir
A Walk In The Park
Fire up the time machine. Our walk in the park took place more than two thousand years ago, on a beautiful sunny day of a long forgotten spring in 380 B.C. Outside the city walls of Athens, under the pleasant shade of olive trees Plato was walking towards the Academy with a beautiful slave boy. The weather was lovely, the dinner was filling, and the conversation turned to philosophy.
"Look at these two students", said Plato carefully picking words to make the question educational. "Who do you think is taller?" The slave boy looked towards the basin of water where two men were standing. "They're about the same height", he said. "What do you mean 'about the same'?", asked Plato. "Well, they look the same from here but I'm sure if I were to get closer I'd see that there is some difference."
Plato smiled. He was leading the boy in the right direction. "So you would say that there is nothing perfectly equal in our world?" After some thinking the boy replied: "I don't think so. Everything is at least a little different, even if we can't see it." The point hit home! "Then if nothing is perfectly equal in this world, how do you think you understand the concept of 'perfect' equality?" The slave boy looked puzzled. "I don't know", he replied.
So was born the first attempt to understand the nature of mathematics. Plato suggested that everything in our world is just an approximation of perfection. He also realized that we understand the concept of perfection even though we never encountered it. He came to conclusion that perfect mathematical forms must live in another world and that we somehow know about them by having a connection to that "alternative" universe. It's fairly clear that there is no perfect circle that we can observe. But we also understand what a perfect circle is and can describe it via equations. What is mathematics, then? Why is the universe described with mathematical laws? Can all of the phenomena of our universe be described by mathematics?2
Philosophy of mathematics is a very complex subject. Like most philosophical disciplines it is far more adept at posing questions rather than providing answers. Much of the consensus revolves around the fact that mathematics is really a puzzle: we set up a set of basic non-conflicting principles and a set of rules on how to operate with these principles. We can then stack these rules together to come up with more complex rules. Mathematicians call this method a "formal system" or a "calculus". We can effectively write a formal system for Tetris if we wanted to. In fact, a working implementation of Tetris is a formal system, just specified using an unusual representation.
A civilization of furry creatures on Alpha Centauri would not be able to read our formalisms of Tetris and circles because their only sensory input might be an organ that senses smells. They likely will never find out about the Tetris formalism, but they very well might have a formalism for circles. We probably wouldn't be able to read it because our sense of smell isn't that sophisticated, but once you get past the representation of the formalism (via various sensory instruments and standard code breaking techniques to understand the language), the concepts underneath are understandable to any intelligent civilization.
Interestingly if no intelligent civilization ever existed in the universe the formalisms for Tetris and circles would still hold water, it's just that nobody would be around to find out about them. If an intelligent civilization popped up, it would likely discover some formalisms that help describe the laws of our universe. They also would be very unlikely to ever find out about Tetris because there is nothing in the universe that resembles it. Tetris is one of countless examples of a formal system, a puzzle, that has nothing to do with the real world. We can't even be sure that natural numbers have full resemblance to the real world, after all one can easily think of a number so big that it cannot describe anything in our universe since it might actually turn out to be finite.

A Bit of History3
Let's shift gears in our time machine. This time we'll travel a lot closer, to the 1930s. The Great Depression was ravaging the New and the Old worlds. Almost every family from every social class was affected by the tremendous economic downturn. Very few sanctuaries remained where people were safe from the perils of poverty. Few people were fortunate enough to be in these sanctuaries, but they did exist. Our interest lies in mathematicians in Princeton University.
The new offices constructed in gothic style gave Princeton an aura of a safe haven. Logicians from all over the world were invited to Princeton to build out a new department. While most of America couldn't find a piece of bread for dinner, high ceilings, walls covered with elaborately carved wood, daily discussions by a cup of tea, and walks in the forest were some of the conditions in Princeton.
One mathematician living in such lavish lifestyle was a young man named Alonzo Church. Alonzo received a B.S. degree from Princeton and was persuaded to stay for graduate school. Alonzo felt the architecture was fancier than necessary. He rarely showed up to discuss mathematics with a cup of tea and he didn't enjoy the walks in the woods. Alonzo was a loner: he was most productive when working on his own. Nevertheless Alonzo had regular contacts with other Princeton inhabitants. Among them were Alan Turing, John von Neumann, and Kurt Gödel.
The four men were interested in formal systems. They didn't pay much heed to the physical world, they were interested in dealing with abstract mathematical puzzles instead. Their puzzles had something in common: the men were working on answering questions about computation. If we had machines that had infinite computational power, what problems would we be able to solve? Could we solve them automatically? Could some problems remain unsolved and why? Would various machines with different designs be equal in power?
In cooperation with other men Alonzo Church developed a formal system called lambda calculus. The system was essentially a programming language for one of these imaginary machines. It was based on functions that took other functions as parameters and returned functions as results. The function was identified by a Greek letter lambda, hence the system's name4. Using this formalism Alonzo was able to reason about many of the above questions and provide conclusive answers.
Independently of Alonzo Church, Alan Turing was performing similar work. He developed a different formalism (now referred to as the Turing machine), and used it to independently come to similar conclusions as Alonzo. Later it was shown that Turing machines and lambda calculus were equivalent in power.
This is where the story would stop, I'd wrap up the article, and you'd navigate to another page, if not for the beginning of World War II. The world was in flames. The U.S. Army and Navy used artillery more often than ever. In attempts to improve accuracy the Army employed a large group of mathematicians to continuously calculate differential equations required for solving ballistic firing tables. It was becoming obvious that the task was too great for being solved manually and various equipment was developed in order to overcome this problem. The first machine to solve ballistic tables was a Mark I built by IBM - it weighed five tons, had 750,000 parts and could do three operations per second.
The race, of course, wasn't over. In 1949 an Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer (EDVAC) was unveiled and had tremendous success. It was a first example of von Neumann's architecture and was effectively a real world implementation of a Turing machine. For the time being Alonzo Church was out of luck.
In late 1950s an MIT professor John McCarthy (also a Princeton graduate) developed interest in Alonzo Church's work. In 1958 he unveiled a List Processing language (Lisp). Lisp was an implementation of Alonzo's lambda calculus that worked on von Neumann computers! Many computer scientists recognized the expressive power of Lisp. In 1973 a group of programmers at MIT's Artificial Intelligence Lab developed hardware they called a Lisp machine - effectively a native hardware implementation of Alonzo's lambda calculus!

Functional Programming
Functional programming is a practical implementation of Alonzo Church's ideas. Not all lambda calculus ideas transform to practice because lambda calculus was not designed to work under physical limitations. Therefore, like object oriented programming, functional programming is a set of ideas, not a set of strict guidelines. There are many functional programming languages, and most of them do many things very differently. In this article I will explain the most widely used ideas from functional languages using examples written in Java (yes, you could write functional programs in Java if you felt particularly masochistic). In the next couple of sections we'll take Java as is, and will make modifications to it to transform it into a useable functional language. Let's begin our quest.
Lambda calculus was designed to investigate problems related to calculation. Functional programming, therefore, primarily deals with calculation, and, surprisingly, uses functions to do so. A function is a very basic unit in functional programming. Functions are used for almost everything, even the simplest of calculations. Even variables are replaced with functions. In functional programming variables are simply aliases for expressions (so we don't have to type everything on one line). They cannot be modified. All variables can only be assigned to once. In Java terms this means that every single variable is declared as final (or const if we're dealing with C++). There are no non-final variables in FP.
final int i = 5;
final int j = i + 3;
Since every variable in FP is final two fairly interesting statements can be made. It does not make sense to always write the keyword final and it does not make sense to call variables, well... variables. We will now make two modifications to Java: every variable declared in our functional Java will be final by default, and we will refer to variables as symbols.
By now you are probably wondering how you could possibly write anything reasonably complicated in our newly created language. If every symbol is non-mutable we cannot change the state of anything! This isn't strictly true. When Alonzo was working on lambda calculus he wasn't interested in maintaining state over periods of time in order to modify it later. He was interested in performing operations on data (also commonly referred to as "calculating stuff"). However, it was proved that lambda calculus is equivalent to a Turing machine. It can do all the same things an imperative programming language can. How, then, can we achieve the same results?
It turns out that functional programs can keep state, except they don't use variables to do it. They use functions instead. The state is kept in function parameters, on the stack. If you want to keep state for a while and every now and then modify it, you write a recursive function. As an example, let's write a function that reverses a Java string. Remember, every variable we declare is final by default5.
String reverse(String arg) {
    if(arg.length == 0) {
        return arg;
    }
    else {
        return reverse(arg.substring(1, arg.length)) + arg.substring(0, 1);
    }
}
This function is slow because it repeatedly calls itself6. It's a memory hog because it repeatedly allocates objects. But it's functional in style. You may be interested why someone would want to program in this manner. Well, I was just about to tell you.

Benefits of FP
You're probably thinking that there's no way I can rationalize the monstrosity of a function above. When I was learning functional programming I was thinking that too. I was wrong. There are very good arguments for using this style. Some of them are subjective. For example, people claim that functional programs are easier to understand. I will leave out these arguments because every kid on the block knows that ease of understanding is in the eye of the beholder. Fortunately for me, there are plenty of objective arguments.
Unit Testing
Since every symbol in FP is final, no function can ever cause side effects. You can never modify things in place, nor can one function modify a value outside of its scope for another function to use (like a class member or a global variable). That means that the only effect of evaluating a function is its return value and the only thing that affects the return value of a function is its arguments.
This is a unit tester's wet dream. You can test every function in your program only worrying about its arguments. You don't have to worry about calling functions in the right order, or setting up external state properly. All you need to do is pass arguments that represent edge cases. If every function in your program passes unit tests you can be a lot more confident about quality of your software than if you were using an imperative language. In Java or C++ checking a return value of a function is not sufficient - it may modify external state that we would need to verify. Not so in a functional language.
Debugging
If a functional program doesn't behave the way you expect it to, debugging it is a breeze. You will always be able to reproduce your problem because a bug in a functional program doesn't depend on unrelated code paths that were executed before it. In an imperative program a bug resurfaces only some of the time. Because functions depend on external state produced by side effects from other functions you may have to go through a series of steps in no way related to the bug. In a functional program this isn't the case - if a return value of a function is wrong, it is always wrong, regardless of what code you execute before running the function.
Once you reproduce the problem, getting to the bottom of it is trivial. It is almost pleasant. You break the execution of your program and examine the stack. Every argument in every function call in the stack is available for your inspection, just like in an imperative program. Except in an imperative program that's not enough because functions depend on member variables, global variables, and the state of other classes (which in turn depend on these very same things). A function in a functional program depends only on its arguments, and that information is right before your eyes! Furthermore, in an imperative program examining a return value of a function will not give you a good idea of whether the function behaves properly. You need to hunt down dozens of objects outside its scope to verify that it performed correct actions. In a functional program all you have to do is look at the return value!
Walking through the stack you look at arguments passed to functions and their return values. The minute a return value doesn't make sense you step into the offending function and walk through it. You repeat this recursively until the process leads you to the source of the bug!
Concurrency
A functional program is ready for concurrency without any further modifications. You never have to worry about deadlocks and race conditions because you don't need to use locks! No piece of data in a functional program is modified twice by the same thread, let alone by two different threads. That means you can easily add threads without ever giving conventional problems that plague concurrency applications a second thought!
If this is the case, why doesn't anybody use functional programs for highly concurrent applications? Well, it turns out that they do. Ericsson designed a functional language called Erlang for use in its highly tolerant and scalable telecommunication switches. Many others recognized the benefits provided by Erlang and started using it. We're talking about telecommunication and traffic control systems that are far more scalable and reliable than typical systems designed on Wall Street. Actually, Erlang systems are not scalable and reliable. Java systems are. Erlang systems are simply rock solid.
The concurrency story doesn't stop here. If your application is inherently single threaded the compiler can still optimize functional programs to run on multiple CPUs. Take a look at the following code fragment:
String s1 = somewhatLongOperation1();
String s2 = somewhatLongOperation2();
String s3 = concatenate(s1, s2);
In a functional language the compiler could analyze the code, classify the functions that create strings s1 and s2 as potentially time consuming operations, and run them concurrently. This is impossible to do in an imperative language because each function may modify state outside of its scope and the function following it may depend on it. In functional languages automatic analysis of functions and finding good candidates for concurrent execution is as trivial as automatic inlining! In this sense functional style programs are "future proof" (as much as I hate buzzwords, I'll indulge this time). Hardware manufacturers can no longer make CPUs run any faster. Instead they increase the number of cores and attribute quadruple speed increases to concurrency. Of course they conveniently forget to mention that we get our money's worth only on software that deals with parallelizable problems. This is a very small fraction of imperative software but 100% of functional software because functional programs are all parallelizable out of the box.

www (GITHUB)
www nedir, world wide web nedir 
World Wide Web, Dünya Çapında Ağ (kısaca WWW veya Web), İnternet üzerinde yayınlanan birbirleriyle bağlantılı hiper-metin dokümanlarından oluşan bir bilgi sistemidir. Bu dokümanların her birine Web sayfası adı verilir ve Web sayfalarına İnternet kullanıcısının bilgisayarında çalışan Web tarayıcısı adı verilen bilgisayar programları aracılığıyla erişilir. Web sayfalarında metin, imaj, video ve diğer multimedya ögeleri bulunabilir ve diğer bağlantı ya da link adı verilen hiper-bağlantılar ile başka Web sayfalarına geçiş yapılabilir.

İnternet ve Web terimleri aynı olguyu tanımlamaz. Zira Web sadece İnternet üzerinde çalışan bir servistir. Web kavramı, CERN'de bir bilgisayar programcısı olan Tim Berners-Lee'nin HTML adlı metin işaretleme dilini geliştirmesiyle oluşmuştur. Bugün de kendisinin başkanı olduğu W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) tarafından standartları belirlenmektedir.

Yapısı
Web’in temeli İnternet'tir. Web İnternet üzerinde kurulmuştur ve İnternet'in sunduğu mekanizmalardan çoğunun kullanılmasını sağlar. İnternet'in fiziksel görünüşleri –bilgisayarlar, ağlar ve servisler– Dünya üzerindeki diğer binlerce bilgisayara bağlanmamıza izin verir. Web, İnternet'in en tepesindeki soyutlanmış genel servisler kümesidir. World Wide Web (W3), insanların fikir ve projelerinin paylaşılmasını sağlayan bir bilgi ve kültür havuzudur. İstemci-sunucu uygulamaları ile yapılan birçok organizasyon üzerinde Web tarayıcıları istemci olarak çalışabilirler. Web yürütümü standart İstemci-sunucu modelini izler. Aşağıdaki şekilde gösterildiği gibi "Web tarayıcısı" adı verilen programı çalıştıran bir istemci bilgisayar ile Web sunucu yazılımı çalıştıran bir sunucu bilgisayar arasındaki etkileşime "istemci-sunucu" etkileşimi adı verilir. İstemci bilgisayar sunucudan HTTP'yi (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) ve İnternet mesaj standardı TCP/IP'yi kullanarak bir doküman ister ve sunucu istemcinin göstereceği dokümanı geri döndürür.-

Alias vs .NET Type	(GITHUB) (asasas)
The predefined data types are alias to their .NET type (CLR class) name. The following table lists alias for predefined data types and related .NET class name.

Byte int falan STRUCT type’mış… Class değilmiş….

 
It means that whether you define a variable of int or Int32, both are the same.
int i = 345;
Int32 i = 345;// same as above 

Default Values
Every data type has a default value. Numeric type is 0, boolean has false, and char has '\0' as default value. Use the default(typename) to assign a default value of the data type or C# 7.1 onward, use default literal.
int i = default(int); // 0
float f = default(float);// 0
decimal d = default(decimal);// 0
bool b = default(bool);// false
char c = default(char);// '\0'

// C# 7.1 onwards
int i = default; // 0
float f = default;// 0
decimal d = default;// 0
bool b = default;// false
char c = default;// '\0'

Conversions
The values of certain data types are automatically converted to different data types in C#. This is called an implicit conversion.
Example: Implicit Conversion
int i = 345;
float f = i;

Console.WriteLine(f); //output: 345

Serverless Architecture / Serverless Computing  / Function as a Service (GITHUB) (asasas)

Serverless nedir

Serverless architecture (also known as serverless computing or function as a service, FaaS) is a software design pattern where applications are hosted by a third-party service, eliminating the need for server software and hardware management by the developer. Applications are broken up into individual functions that can be invoked and scaled individually.

Why Serverless Architecture?
Hosting a software application on the internet usually involves managing some kind of server infrastructure. Typically this means a virtual or physical server that needs to be managed, as well as the operating system and other web server hosting processes required for your application to run. Using a virtual server from a cloud provider such as Amazon or Microsoft does mean the elimination of the physical hardware concerns, but still requires some level of management of the operating system and the web server software processes.
With a serverless architecture, you focus purely on the individual functions in your application code. Services such as Twilio Functions, AWS Lambda and Microsoft Azure Functions take care of all the physical hardware, virtual machine operating system, and web server software management. You only need to worry about your code.

How does Serverless or FaaS Differ from PaaS?
PaaS, or Platform as a Service, products such as Heroku, Azure Web Apps and AWS Elastic Beanstalk offer many of the same benefits as Serverless (sometimes called Function as a Service or FaaS). They do eliminate the need for management of server hardware and software. The primary difference is in the way you compose and deploy your application, and therefore the scalability of your application.
With PaaS, your application is deployed as a single unit and is developed in the traditional way using some kind of web framework like ASP.NET, Flask, Ruby on Rails, Java Servlets, etc. Scaling is only done at the entire application level. You can decide to run multiple instances of your application to handle additional load.
With FaaS, you compose your application into individual, autonomous functions. Each function is hosted by the FaaS provider and can be scaled automatically as function call frequency increases or decreases. This turns out to be a very cost effective way of paying for compute resources. You only pay for the times that your functions get called, rather than paying to have your application always on and waiting for requests on so many different instances.
Who Should Use Serverless?
You should especially consider using a serverless provider if you have a small number of functions that you need hosted. If your application is more complex, a serverless architecture can still be beneficial, but you will need to architect your application very differently. This may not be feasible if you have an existing application. It may make more sense to migrate small pieces of the application into serverless functions over time.
Using a product like Twilio Functions is especially helpful for builders and developers wanting to implement a Twilio solution. They are able to select pre-defined templates and deploy common communications use-cases without the need to host a server or use any other providers.

serialize and deserialize (marshal and unmarshal)  	(GITHUB) (testset)
marshal nedir, unmarshal nedir, deserialize nedir, serialize nedir, Serialization nedir

Serialization converts objects into a byte stream and brings it to a form that it can be written on stream. This is done to save it to memory, file or database.
This article shows how to use the System.Text.Json namespace to serialize to and deserialize from JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). 
The directions and sample code use the library directly, not through a framework such as ASP.NET Core.
Most of the serialization sample code sets JsonSerializerOptions.WriteIndented to true to "pretty-print" the JSON (with indentation and whitespace for human readability). For production use, you would typically accept the default value of false for this setting.
The code examples refer to the following class and variants of it:
public class WeatherForecast
{
    public DateTimeOffset Date { get; set; }
    public int TemperatureCelsius { get; set; }
    public string Summary { get; set; }
}
The System.Text.Json namespace contains all the entry points and the main types. The System.Text.Json.Serialization namespace contains attributes and APIs for advanced scenarios and customization specific to serialization and deserialization. The code examples shown in this article require using directives for one or both of these namespaces:
using System.Text.Json;
using System.Text.Json.Serialization;
Attributes from the System.Runtime.Serialization namespace aren't currently supported in System.Text.Json.
To write JSON to a string or to a file, call the JsonSerializer.Serialize method.
The following example creates JSON as a string:
string jsonString;
jsonString = JsonSerializer.Serialize(weatherForecast);
The following example uses synchronous code to create a JSON file:
jsonString = JsonSerializer.Serialize(weatherForecast);
File.WriteAllText(fileName, jsonString);
The following example uses asynchronous code to create a JSON file:
using (FileStream fs = File.Create(fileName))
{
    await JsonSerializer.SerializeAsync(fs, weatherForecast);
}
The preceding examples use type inference for the type being serialized. An overload of Serialize() takes a generic type parameter:
jsonString = JsonSerializer.Serialize<WeatherForecastWithPOCOs>(weatherForecast);
Here's an example class that contains collection-type properties and a user-defined type:
public class WeatherForecastWithPOCOs
{
    public DateTimeOffset Date { get; set; }
    public int TemperatureCelsius { get; set; }
    public string Summary { get; set; }
    public string SummaryField;
    public IList<DateTimeOffset> DatesAvailable { get; set; }
    public Dictionary<string, HighLowTemps> TemperatureRanges { get; set; }
    public string[] SummaryWords { get; set; }
}

public class HighLowTemps
{
    public int High { get; set; }
    public int Low { get; set; }
}
The JSON output from serializing an instance of the preceding type looks like the following example. The JSON output is minified by default:
{"Date":"2019-08-01T00:00:00-07:00","TemperatureCelsius":25,"Summary":"Hot","DatesAvailable":["2019-08-01T00:00:00-07:00","2019-08-02T00:00:00-07:00"],"TemperatureRanges":{"Cold":{"High":20,"Low":-10},"Hot":{"High":60,"Low":20}},"SummaryWords":["Cool","Windy","Humid"]}

The following example shows the same JSON, but formatted (that is, pretty-printed with whitespace and indentation):
{
  "Date": "2019-08-01T00:00:00-07:00",
  "TemperatureCelsius": 25,
  "Summary": "Hot",
  "DatesAvailable": [
    "2019-08-01T00:00:00-07:00",
    "2019-08-02T00:00:00-07:00"
  ],
  "TemperatureRanges": {
    "Cold": {
      "High": 20,
      "Low": -10
    },
    "Hot": {
      "High": 60,
      "Low": 20
    }
  },
  "SummaryWords": [
    "Cool",
    "Windy",
    "Humid"
  ]

CLR / Common Language Runtime		(GITHUB) 		(read)
clr nedir
The Common Language Runtime (CLR) is the virtual machine component of Microsoft's .NET framework and is responsible for managing the execution of .NET programs. In a process known as just-in-time (JIT) compilation, the CLR compiles the intermediate language code known as CIL into the machine instructions that in turn are executed by the computer's CPU. The CLR provides additional services including memory management, type safety and exception handling. All programs written for the .NET framework, regardless of programming language, are executed by the CLR. It provides exception handling, Garbage collection and thread management.
The exact meaning depends on the context, but Common Language Runtime usually refers to the runtime of .NET Framework. The CLR handles memory allocation and management. The CLR is also a virtual machine that not only executes apps but also generates and compiles code on-the-fly using a JIT compiler. The current Microsoft CLR implementation is Windows only.
.Net Framework ün en alt katmanında CLR (Common Languange Runtime – Ortak Dil Platformu) mevcuttur. 
.Net platformunda yazılmış olan kodların (c#, J# veya VB) ortak bir alanda işletim sisteminizin algılayacağı dile çevrilmesini sağlamaktadır. Bu işlem sırasında kodlar ilk olarak MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Languange – Ara Dil) e çevrilir. Bu dönüştürmenin sebebi işletim sisteminin algılayacağı dile dönüştürmeden önce farklı dillerde yazılan kodları ortak noktada buluşturmaktır. Böylelikle MSIL kodu CLR katmanı ile farklı işletim sistemlerinde çalıştırılabilir hale gelir ve gelecekte yeni bir dille yazılan kodlar da MSIL a dönüştürerek işletim sisteminde çalışmasını sağlayacaktır.

GUI 			(GITHUB)
GUI nedir, gui nedir
 
A graphical user interface (GUI) is a type of user interface through which users interact with electronic devices via visual indicator representations.

What is a Graphical User Interface?
The graphical user interface, developed in the late 1970s by the Xerox Palo Alto research laboratory and deployed commercially in Apple’s Macintosh and Microsoft’s Windows operating systems, was designed as a response to the problem of inefficient usability in early, text-based command-line interfaces for the average user.
Graphical user interfaces would become the standard of user-centered design in software application programming, providing users the capability to intuitively operate computers and other electronic devices through the direct manipulation of graphical icons such as buttons, scroll bars, windows, tabs, menus, cursors, and the mouse pointing device. Many modern graphical user interfaces feature touchscreen and voice-command interaction capabilities.
How Does a Graphical User Interface Work?
Graphical user interface design principles conform to the model–view–controller software pattern, which separates internal representations of information from the manner in which information is presented to the user, resulting in a platform where users are shown which functions are possible rather than requiring the input of command codes. Users interact with information by manipulating visual widgets, which are designed to respond in accordance with the type of data they hold and support the actions necessary to complete the user’s task.

The appearance, or “skin,” of an operating system or application software may be redesigned at will due to the nature of graphical user interfaces being independent from application functions. Applications typically implement their own unique graphical user interface display elements in addition to graphical user interface elements already present on the existing operating system. A typical graphical user interface also includes standard formats for representing graphics and text, making it possible to share data between applications running under common graphical user interface design software.

Graphical user interface testing refers to the systematic process of generating test cases in order to evaluate the functionality of the system and its design elements. Graphical user interface testing tools, which are either manual or automated and typically implemented by third-party operators, are available under a variety of licenses and are supported by a variety of platforms. Popular examples include: Tricentis Tosca, Squish GUI Tester, Unified Functional Testing (UFT), Maveryx, Appium, and eggPlant Functional.

Graphical User Interface Examples
Sketchpad, believed to be the first graphical computer-aided design program, was developed in 1962 by Ivan Sutherland while he was at MIT, and consisted of a light pen that enabled users to create and manipulate objects in engineering drawings in real time with coordinated graphics.
Modern operating systems and graphical user interfaces are incorporated into nearly every interactive application, such as ATMs, self-service checkouts, airline self-ticketing and check-in, video games, smartphones, and desktops. Some popular, modern graphical user interface examples include Microsoft Windows, macOS, Ubuntu Unity, and GNOME Shell for desktop environments, and Android, Apple's iOS, BlackBerry OS, Windows 10 Mobile, Palm OS-WebOS, and Firefox OS for smartphones.
Advantages of Graphical User Interfaces
The advantage of a graphical user interface is a stark improvement in useability for the average person. The features of a graphical user interface leverage familiar metaphors, such as drag-and-drop for transferring files, and use familiar icons, such as a trash bin for deleted files, creating an environment in which computer operations are intuitive and easily mastered without any prior practice or knowledge of computing machinery or languages. Graphical user interface applications are self descriptive, feedback is typically immediate, and visual cues encourage and steer discoverability.
Best Programming Language for Graphical User Interfaces
While there are several different visual programming languages with their own unique advantages for the development of a graphical user interface design, C# or Java may be considered preferable options due to their ability to run GUIs simultaneously in a browser and as a desktop application. Other options include Python, HTML5/Javascript, and C/C++.
Difference Between Character User Interface and Graphical User Interface
Character user interface, also known as command-line user interface or non graphical user interface, refers to the use of text commands, managed by a command-line interpreter, in order to communicate with a computer program. Typically software developers and system administrators rely on command-line interfaces to configure machines, manage computer files, and access program features that are otherwise unavailable on a graphical user interface.
Character user interfaces support automation and scripting and tend to provide greater granular control and a higher level of functionality than graphical user interfaces. While the character user interface was the primary method of operating computers through the 1980s, most modern electronic devices are equipped with intuitive graphical user interfaces and the average user will rarely if ever have cause to access a computer terminal.

Difference Between Web User Interface and Graphical User Interface
A web user interface, or web-based graphical user interface, refers to the interaction between a user and software running on a web server wherein the user interface is the web browser and the web page it downloaded and rendered. Technologies such as Flash, Java, JavaScript, and Silverlight enable interactions such as drag-and-drop, playing audio, drawing on the screen, and access to the keyboard and mouse.
Web graphical user interfaces are platform independent, require no installation or separate software development, easy to update and monitor due to the nature of not being dependent upon the user to deploy updates, provides a vibrant UI experience, and are low cost, requiring only Ethernet or WiFi interface connectivity.
Does OmniSci Offer Graphical User Interface Solutions?
The benefits of visualizations in computing are evident in the intuitive nature of graphical user interfaces. Visualization and interactivity are similarly beneficial elements in data analytics. OmniSci Immerse is a browser-based, interactive data visualization client that works seamlessly with the OmniSci server-side technologies, OmniSciDB and Render, providing an interactive, visual platform that reduces the time to insights and dramatically expands an analyst's ability to find previously hidden insights.

Kestrel 	(GITHUB)
Kestrel nedir?
Kestrel bir Web Server'dır. Projeyi Visual Studio'dan çalıştırırsan proje IISExpress'i Web Server olarak kullanır. Ama: CLI üzerinden çalıştırırsan da KESTREL'i Web Server olarak kullanır.
What is Kestrel?
Kestrel is an open source, cross platform, light weight and a default webserver used for Asp.Net Core applications. Asp.Net Core applications run Kestrel webserver as in-process server to handle web request. Kestrel webserver is based on async I/O library called libuv primarily developed for Node.js.
By default, all Asp.Net core project templates include Kestrel webserver when we create new Asp.Net Core Projects. As said before, Kestrel is a very light weight webserver that does not have every advanced features of webservers like IIS, Nginx, Apache, etc has. Due to its lightweight nature, Kestrel provides better request processing performance to Asp.Net Core applications. Some features of Kestrel,
1.	Kestrel does not support multiple applications sharing same port similar to IIS where applications are differentiated by host header value.
2.	Kestrel is cross platform, runs in Windows, LINUX and Mac.
3.	Kestrel webserver supports SSL.
Let’s understand why there is a new webserver called Kestrel when we already have a feature-rich and most used webserver IIS.

Why Kestrel Webserver when we have IIS/Nginx/Apache?
The primary requirement of Asp.Net Core is to make Asp.Net Core applications to run across multiple platforms (or cross platform). Though, IIS is feature rich and highly used webserver it is a windows-only webserver. Without Kestrel, to run Asp.Net Core application on other cross platform webservers like Nginx, Apache, the Asp.Net Core application need to satisfy the Startup criteria of each of these webservers. In other words, each webserver has a different Startup configurations and this will make Asp.Net Core applications have different Startup mechanisms. This is why Asp.Net Core applications use Kestrel webserver as an in-process server where the application will have same and consistent Startup (Main() and Startup.ConfigireServices() & Startup.Configure()) process even when offering cross platform support.
 
How to use Kestrel?
Kestrel server is by default included in the Asp.Net Core project templates. It is included in the project as a Nuget package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel in Project.json(in Visual Studio 2015) and as an implicitly included package when you using Visual Studio 2017 project template.
Note – All Asp.Net Core project should use Visual Studio 2017 as it is the latest and default project template for Asp.Net Core projects henceforth. Read here to know more.
Let’s see how kestrel server is configured in an Asp.Net Core project. Below is the Program.Main() method in a Asp.Net Core application.
 
public class Program
{
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var host = new WebHostBuilder()
        .UseKestrel()
        .UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())
        .UseIISIntegration()
        .UseStartup<Startup>()
        .UseApplicationInsights()
        .Build();

    host.Run();
}
}

In the above Main() method, calling UseKestrel() on WebHostBuilder object will configure the Kestrel webserver for the application.
Note – Every Asp.Net Core application requires a Host process to start Kestrel webserver and initialize application for request processing. Calling UseIISIntegration() integrates Kestrel with IIS webserver, let’s see this in detail in next section.
The UseKestrel() also takes KestrelServerOptions class as argument to customize Kestrel server.
 
Asp.Net Core Deployment Options
We generally deploy Asp.Net Core (also Asp.Net applications) for 2 scenarios listed below.
1.	Internal Hosted applications
2.	Externally Hosted applications
Let’s see how Kestrel webserver can be used in both of these scenarios.
1.	Internally Hosted applications
For internal applications, the applications can just be hosted with Kestrel webserver alone. The features provided by Kestrel and with some additional middlewares (for response compressions, authentication) is sufficient for serving internally hosted applications.  
2.	Externally Hosted applications
As it is said before, Kestrel is a very light webserver and it does not support all features of a full-fledged webserver like IIS provide. So, if your application is external facing public website then the application should be deployed behind a full-fledged webserver like IIS or Nginx or Apache for increased security and to get feature rich support. These webservers act as proxy (commonly called reverse proxy in this scenario) and forward the request to Kestrel for request processing. This is why the Program.Main() code calls UseIISIntegration() to integrate IIS as reverse proxy to forward request to Kestrel. This is the default mode the project template code uses.  The request flow goes like below,
 
Note – This requires IIS integration module commonly called Asp.Net Core module that comes with Nuget package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.IISIntegration
 
Executing the Asp.Net Core Application with Kestrel
We can start the Asp.Net application that uses Kestrel webserver in two ways. Assuming, you have created a default Asp.Net Core project in Visual Studio 2017.
1.	Visual Studio
By default, press F5 to start the application with IISExpress as reverse proxy. To start the application from Kestrel webserver click project name menu item in run dropdown like below. ASPNETCoreVS2017Demo is my project name.
 
This will start the app directly form Kestrel webserver.
2.	Dotnet CLI
You can also start the app from command prompt using dotnet CLI(Command Line Interface) provide by Asp.Net Core. To do this, open Command prompt and change directory to project root. Type the below command
 
dotnet run
 
 
This will start the app with Kestrel webserver and server will start listening to port 5000 by default. Refer the below image.
 
Visiting http://localhost:5000 will bring the application like below,

Race Condition	(GITHUB) (testset)
Race condition nedir
It is also called race hazard. It is a behavior of software or system where output is based on the sequence or timing of other uncontrolled events. It becomes painful or bug when events do not happen in the order in which functionality is required.

Race condition occurs when two threads access a shared variable at the same time. The first thread reads the variable, and the second thread writes to the same variable at the same time.
 Symptoms of Race Condition
The most common symptom of a race condition is unexpected values of variable that are shared between multiple threads. In this case, sometimes one thread wins, and sometimes the other thread wins. At the other times, the result of execution may be correct. Also, if each thread executes separately, the result of variable comes expected.

 Example:
 Let us have two threads - Thread1 and Thread2 and both run simultaneously and lock has been not applied then result will be wrong.
This situation happened because locks were not applied and race condition happened.
1.	Int myValue = 0;  
2.	Thread1 ---Reads value-------> 0  
3.	Thread2 --Reads Value--------> 0  
4.	Thread1 --Increases value with one and writes back----> 0 +1  
5.	Same time,  
6.	Thread2 --Increases value with one and writes back ------> 0+1  
7.	Final Result = 1  
8.	Expected Result = 2  
This situation happened because locks were not applied and race condition happened. 
 Avoid Race Condition:
 Best approach to handle race condition is to write code very carefully and proactively. Always try to use locks, mutexes, ManualResetEvents, etc to make code thread safe in the case of multi-threaded environment.

Deadlock
Deadlock nedir
Deadlock case happens in concurrent or multi-threaded environment. It is kind of a situation in which two or more competing threads or tasks wait for the other task to finish and they never finish.
 It is a vary famous problem in multi processing systems, parallel computing and distributed systems. This case basically happens with the shared resource. This resource locks in this case. Deadlock has very vast explanation.
 Conditions of Deadlock
 A condition is called Deadlock if the following condition matches:
1.	Mutual Exclusion: Only process can use the resource at the given time.
2.	Hold and Wait
3.	No Preemption
4.	Circular Wait
These four conditions are know as the Coffman Conditions. Edward G. Coffman, Jr. described this in his article published in 1971.
Ways to Make an Object Thread-Safe
The following are the three approaches to make an object thread-safe:
1.	Synchronize the critical section.
2.	Make it immutable
3.	Use a thread-safe wrapper
Questions based on Thread-Safety
Question: Is the C# Static Constructor Thread -Safe?
 Static constructors are guaranteed to be run only once per application domain, before any instances of a class are created or any static members are accessed.
 Using a Static Constructor actually is Thread-Safe.
 Question: Is C# Static Method Thread-Safe?
 Static methods are not inherently thread-safe. CLR of C# doesn't thread different than instance method.
 Question: Is C# Delegate Thread-Safe?
 Modifying event is not thread-safe, but invoking a Delegate is thread-safe. Since a Delegate is immutable type so it is thread safe.

Tag Helpers vs HTML Helpers	(GITHUB) (örnek)
Tag Helpers attach to HTML elements in Razor views, (adı üzerinde: tag helper, yani tag’larla ilgili…) while HTML Helpers are invoked as methods interspersed with HTML in Razor views. Consider the following Razor markup, which creates an HTML label with the CSS class "caption":

@Html.Label("FirstName", "First Name:", new {@class="caption"})
The at (@) symbol tells Razor this is the start of code. The next two parameters ("FirstName" and "First Name:") are strings, so IntelliSense can't help. The last argument:

new {@class="caption"}
(anonymous object nedir)
Is an anonymous object used to represent attributes. Because class is a reserved keyword in C#, you use the @ symbol to force C# to interpret @class= as a symbol (property name). To a front-end designer (someone familiar with HTML/CSS/JavaScript and other client technologies but not familiar with C# and Razor), most of the line is foreign. The entire line must be authored with no help from IntelliSense.
Using the LabelTagHelper, the same markup can be written as:
<label class="caption" asp-for="FirstName"></label>
With the Tag Helper version, as soon as you enter <l in the Visual Studio editor, IntelliSense displays matching elements:
 
IntelliSense helps you write the entire line.
The following code image shows the Form portion of the Views/Account/Register.cshtml Razor view generated from the ASP.NET 4.5.x MVC template included with Visual Studio.
 
The Visual Studio editor displays C# code with a grey background. For example, the AntiForgeryToken HTML Helper:
@Html.AntiForgeryToken()

is displayed with a grey background. Most of the markup in the Register view is C#. Compare that to the equivalent approach using Tag Helpers:
 
The markup is much cleaner and easier to read, edit, and maintain than the HTML Helpers approach. The C# code is reduced to the minimum that the server needs to know about. The Visual Studio editor displays markup targeted by a Tag Helper in a distinctive font.
Consider the Email group:

<div class="form-group">
    <label asp-for="Email" class="col-md-2 control-label"></label>
    <div class="col-md-10">
        <input asp-for="Email" class="form-control" />
        <span asp-validation-for="Email" class="text-danger"></span>
    </div>
</div>
Each of the "asp-" attributes has a value of "Email", but "Email" isn't a string. In this context, "Email" is the C# model expression property for the RegisterViewModel.
The Visual Studio editor helps you write all of the markup in the Tag Helper approach of the register form, while Visual Studio provides no help for most of the code in the HTML Helpers approach. IntelliSense support for Tag Helpers goes into detail on working with Tag Helpers in the Visual Studio editor.

Apache Subversion / Subversion (eski adı) / SVN	(GITHUB) (test)
apache subversion nedir, subversion nedir, svn nedir
SVN: Subversion bir sürüm takip sistemidir. Kısaca SVN olarak da adlandırılmaktadır.
Ortak bir depoda sürümlenmiş şekilde saklanan proje dosyalarını geliştiriceler kendilerine tanımlanmış kullanıcı adı ile çekebilirler. Kendi depolama alanına çekilen bu dosyalar üzerinde işlemler yapıp tekrar ortak depoya gönderebilirler.
Yazılım geliştirmede Apache Subversion (eski adıyla Subversion[1], 2000 yılında CollabNet firması tarafından başlatılan ve desteklenen bir sürüm kontrol sistemidir. Yazılım geliştiricileri Subversion'ı kaynak kodu, ağ sayfaları veya belgelendirme gibi dosyaların güncel ve geçmiş tüm değişikliklerini tutmak için kullanırlar. Amacı yaygın olarak kullanılan Concurrent Versions System (CVS)'in olabildiğince uyumlu bir ardılı olmaktır.
Açık kaynak topluluğu Subversion'ı yaygın olarak kullanmıştır: örneğin Apache Software Foundation projelerinde, Free Pascal, FreeBSD, GCC, Django, Ruby, Mono, SourceForge, ExtJS, Tigris.org, PHP ve MediaWiki. Google Code açık kaynak proje barındırmalarında Subversion desteği de vermektedir. CodePlex diğer istemcilere olduğu kadar Subversion erişimi de sağlamaktadır.
İş dünyası da Subversion kullanımı kabul etmeye başlamıştır. Forrester Research tarafından 2007 yılında hazırlanan bir rapora göre Tekbaşına Yazılım Konfigürasyonu Yönetimi (SCM) kategorisinde Subversion'ı lider ve Yazılım Konfigürasyonu ve Değişiklik Yönetimi (SCCM) alanında da güçlü bir oyuncu gösterilmiştir.[2]
Subversion Apache Lisansını kullanmaktadır ve açık kaynak kodludur.

CVS / Concurrent Versions System	(test) (test)

Cvs nedir, concurrent versions system nedir
Concurrent Versions System (CVS) is a program that lets a code developer save and retrieve different development versions of source code. It also lets a team of developers share control of different versions of files in a common repository of files. This kind of program is sometimes known as a version control system . CVS was created in the UNIX operating system environment and is available in both Free Software Foundation and commercial versions. It is a popular tool for programmers working on Linux and other UNIX-based systems.
CVS works not by keeping track of multiple copies of source code files, but by maintaining a single copy and a record of all the changes. When a developer specifies a particular version, CVS can reconstruct that version from the recorded changes. CVS is typically used to keep track of each developer's work individually in a separate working directory. When desired, the work of a team of developers can be merged in a common repository. Changes from individual team members can be added to the repository through a "commit" command.
CVS uses another program, Revision Control System (RCS), to do the actual revision management - that is, keeping the record of changes that go with each source code file. The writers of the most popular CVS Frequently Asked Questions document are careful to emphasize that CVS is not a build system, a code configuration management system, or a substitute for other good development practices, but simply a way to control the versions of the pieces of a program as they are developed.

Revision Control System (RCS)	(GITHUB) (test)
Rcs nedir, revision control system nedir
Revision Control System (RCS) is an early version control system (VCS). It is a set of UNIX commands that allow multiple users to develop and maintain program code or documents. With RCS, users can make their own revisions of a document, commit changes, and merge them. RCS was originally developed for programs but is also useful for text documents or configuration files that are frequently revised.

RCS was first released in 1982[3] by Walter F. Tichy at Purdue University. It was an alternative tool to the then-popular Source Code Control System (SCCS) which was nearly the first version control software tool (developed in 1972 by early Unix developers).[4] RCS is currently maintained by the GNU Project.[5]
An innovation in RCS is the adoption of reverse deltas. Instead of storing every revision in a file like SCCS does with interleaved deltas, RCS stores a set of edit instructions to go back to an earlier version of the file. Tichy claims that it is faster for most cases because the recent revisions are used more often.

Abstraction ve Encapsulation tam olarak nedir?	(GITHUB) (test)

Abstraction nedir, encapsulation nedir
(Tarık Güney’in yazısı, Amerika, Motorola)
Geçenlerde bir mülakatta sordum abstraction nedir diye. Cevap alamadım. Junior pozisyonu olduğu için normal karşıladım aslında. Sonra kendisine günlük hayattaki manasıyla abstraction kelimesinden ne anlıyorsun diye sordum. Ona da cevap veremeyince, bu kavramların zannedildiği kadar anlaşılmış ve bilinen meseleler olmadığını düşünmeme neden oldu ve bu yazı çıktı karşınıza.
Ne kadar da çok çıkıyor karşımıza bu iki kavram yazılım hayatımız boyunca. Hemen hemen her mülakatın, özellikle de OOP kullanan şirketlerin devamlı sorduğu sorulardandır abstraction ve encapsulation kavramlarının ne oldukları ve aralarındaki farklar. Bu kadar çok sorulması, bu kavramları değersizleştiren ve sıradanlaştıran bir sorun olarak görülmesin. Çoğu insan terimleri kavramsal düzeyde bilmiyor. Genelde implementasyon açılarından biliyorlar. Mesela, abstraction nedir diye sorun: Sınıfları, arayüzler arkasında saklamaktır… diye cevap alırsınız. Hatta daha somut şekilde bile cevaplar gelir: Arayüzler bir soyutlamadır. Geçenlerde bir mülakatta kendisine Dependency Injection nedir diye sorduğum senior bir mühendis bana Spring framework içinde sınıfların nasıl inject edildiğinden bahsetmeye başladı. Anlaşılan ilk defa DI ile orada tanıştı ve bunu formülize edip ortaya genel bir kavram çıkaramadı. Terimler, kendilerini oluşturan sebep ve sonuçlar zaviyesinden anlaşılmayınca, bu şekilde ki cevaplar kaçınılmaz oluyor. Bana insanı anlat deyince, yakın arkadaşı Ali’yi anlatması ve onunla ne kadar da iyi zaman geçirdiğinden bahsetmesi gibi bir durum bu aslında.
Nedir Abstraction
Yazılım kariyerim boyunca keşfettiğim en değerli şeyin abstraction olmasından dolayı, ondan başlayacağım anlatmaya. Yazılımdaki manasını bir kenarı koyalım. Nedir aslında abstraction? Kainattaki tüm varlığın üzerine bina edildiği bir kavramdır o. Varlığı anlamamızı mümkün kılan müthiş bir olay abstraction. Kullandığınız her kelimeyi ve hissettiğiniz her varlığı çepeçevre sarmıştır aslında. Halbuki ne kadar da az biliniyor değeri! İlimler abstraction sayesinde var oldu. İnsanoğlu abstraction sayesinde devamlı gelişti. En büyük aşkların arkasında abstraction vardı. Çocuğunuza karşı hissettiğiniz o tanımsız şefkat ve sevgiyi sımsıcak kolları ile sarmalayan, abstraction’tan başkası değildi. Eğer abstraction olmasaydı, şu an sizinle burada konuşamıyor olurduk. Hayat söner, varlık yok olur, ve mânâ anlamsızlaşmaya başlardı.
Bu kadar önemli olayların arkasındaki bu kavramın çok basit bir tanımı var aslında: Bir varlık ya da sistemi incelerken, fiziksel, mekansal, ve zamansal nitelikleri içinden ilgimizi çekmeyen kısımları ayıklamak sureti ile sadece işimize yarayan kısımlara odaklanmak. Abstraction olmasaydı matematikte hiç bir formül hayat bulamazdı. Genellemeler yapamaz, varlığı anlayamaz ve kaybolur giderdik. Sanat var olmazdı. Ne kaldı ki geriye?
Şimdiye kadar soyut düzlemde anlattığım herşeyi somut akla indirgemek için bir örnek vereyim. “Türkler” kelimesi bir soyutlamadır. Altına milyonlarca insan girer. Ama bireysel temelde birbirlerinden yüzlerce hatta binlerce farkı olan bu insanların, ortak olan bazı taraflarını almak sureti ile onları kategorize etmek, işte bu bir abstractiondır. Daha açık konuşmak gerekirse, aynı coğrafya, dil, ve kültürü paylaşmalarını alıp, diğer tüm taraflarını göz ardı etmektir buradaki abstraction. Türkler deyince hanginizin aklına bu insanların aslında hepsinde ortak olan diğer özellikler geldi? Mesela hepsinin bağırsaklarının olması, hepsinin böbreklere sahip olması, yemek yerlerken tükürük bezlerinden salgılanan kimyasallar ile nişastayı daha ağızlarından itibaren sindirime başlamaları… Kim düşündü bu kısımları?
Peki abstraction ile sahip olduğumuz bu güç hiç var olmasaydı? Türkler demek sureti ile bir kelime ile anlatabildiğiniz bir kavramı söylemek için ne kadar da çok şey söylemeniz gerekirdi, farkında mısınız? Hatta o çok şey bile başka abstract (soyut) ifadelerden oluşacağı için, konuşmanız imkansız hale gelirdi. Hatta düşünemez olurduk. İlim böyle bir şey aslında. Avam bir insan ile alim bir insanın Türk kelimesinden anlayacağı şeyler çok farklı olacaktır. Soyut bir kavramın arkasındaki hakikatleri ne kadar çok bilirseniz, o kadar bilgilisiniz demektir. Avam bir insan, Türk kelimesini duyunca, kendi köyünde, şehrinde, ülkesinde yaşayanlar ve beraber döner yedikleri insanları görür. Alim ise onların sosyo-kültürel ve sosyo-ekonomik benzerliklerini, tarihlerini, kültürel referanslarındaki ortaklıklarını, dillerini, bakış açılarını, vs. görür ve bunlar üzerinden yorumlarını yapar. Bir kitap, şimşeklerden bahsederken, onları bulutları aşılayan ve yağmur yağmasına neden olan bir olay olarak anlatır; bundan ben, çamaşırlar ıslanacak, gideyim de toplayayım manasını çıkarırım, bir alim ise bundan atomları, eletronları, bulutların dinamiğini, vs. görür ve mest olur. İşte okumak ve öğrenmek her gün karşımızda abstract (soyut) olarak boy gösteren olayların arkası dediğimiz implementasyon detaylarını (nasılını ve hatta nedenini) anlamak içindir. Ellerimi her gün yıkadığım ve bana göre tek kullanım amacı temizlik ve bolca köpürmek olan sabunun, çalışma mantığını anladığım zaman, varlığını bile göremediğim küçük parçacıkların bu kadar akıllı bir çalışma mekaniğine sahip olması karşısında hayranlığımı ve heyecanımı gizlebildiğimi zannetmiyorum.
En büyük aşklar bile abstraction sayesinde var olur dedim. Hanginiz sevdiğine bakarken, midesini, böbreklerini, alyuvarlarını, su içerken yemek borusundan suyun akıp sindirimine karışmasını, vs. görüyor ve bunlara aşık oluyor? Ya da kaçınız onu bu özelliklerinden soyutlayıp, güzel konuşmasına, gülümsemesine, bakışlarına bakarak seviyor?
Bir cekete bakın. İçindeki ipliği, düğmeleri, dokuması, boyası, cepleri, vs. ile onlarca ve yüzlerce küçük ve birbirleri ile tamamen alakasız parçalardan oluşuyor. Ama hepsi bir amaç uğruna bir araya geliyor. Bizler de, uğruna bir araya geldikleri bu amaç açısından onlara bakıyor ve tüm bu parçalara bir isim veriyoruz: Ceket. Bu mantığı çok iyi anlayın. Çünkü bu ufacık paragrafta anlattığım mantık, abstraction’ın yazılımda ne manaya geldiğini anlatıyor. Bir spor takımının taraftarlarına bakın. Hepsi farklı hikayelerin bambaşka oyuncuları aslında. Ama ortak bir hedefleri var: Takımlarının başarılı olmaları. Paylaştıkları bu ortak noktadan bu insanları inceliyor, farklılıklarını ve diğer benzerliklerini bir kenarı koyuyor, ve hedeflerinin ortaklığından dolayı onlara taraftar diyoruz. Çünkü onlar takımlarının kazanmasına taraftarlar…

 
Yukarıdaki resme bakın. Ev ile alakalı binlerce detayın silinip, sadece belli bir kısmını göstermek ile çizildiğini göreceksiniz. Böyle olmasa resim çizebilir miyiz?


Harflere bakın. Onlar aslında seslerin birer soyutlamasıdır. “A” sesini çıkarırken, ses tellerimizin sebep olduğunu titreşimlerin havanın titreşmesiyle ilerleyip kulak zarımıza çarpıp, sonra beynimize elektrik sinyalleri olarak giden tüm bu mekanik olayın en yalın soyutlamasıdır belki “A” ve “a” harfleri. Meydana gelen bu tüm fiziksel olayların varlık amacında ki ortak noktalardan bir tanesi A sesinin var olmasıdır. Biz de onu A harfi ile kağıt üzerinde aslında bir resim olarak gösteriyoruz.
Araba kullanmanıza bir bakın: Bir direksiyon, iki pedal, ve bir vites. Arkada çalışan onca parçanın ortak noktası işte bunlar. Yüzlerce parçanın var olma amacı, bizim görebildiğimiz gaz ve frenin çalışmasını sağlamak. Dolayısıyla bir kaç parça ile soyutlanmış devasa bir mühendislik harikası… Ya da tüm bunları göz ardı edip, güç açısından bakabilirsiniz. Bir at ile bir motor arasında ki benzerlikler güçtür. Birisi bir beygir gücünde, diğer 150.
Her gün kullandığımız dürüstlük, ahlak, terbiye gibi ifadeler aslında kendilerini oluşturan onlarca davranışın ortak noktasını anlatan soyutlamalardır.
Daha binlerce, yüzbinlerce, milyonlarca örnek her an yanımızdan ve içimizden geçip gidiyor. Ne kadar müthiş, ne kadar sade, ne kadar alçak gönüllü, ne kadar hayattar, ne kadar muhteşem bir kavramdır abstraction. Ne kadar vefalı bir dost ve ne kadar sağlam bir omuz.
Yazılımda Abstraction
Yazılımcılar olarak bizlerin kullandığı abstraction ise şimdiye kadar anlattıklarımın içinde küçücük bir yer alıyor. Farklı katmanlar içinde soyutlamanın kullanılmadığı hemen hemen hiç bir yer yok gibidir. Çok basit bir örnek vereyim. Sizce aşağıda ki bir satırlık bir kod abstraction içerir mi? Durun ve şimdiye kadar anlattıklarım ile olaya bakın:
string hello = "world";
Yukarıda hiç interface yok, ya da class, ya da inheritance. Ama abstraction dağ gibi duruyor tam orada. Hem de birden fazla. Bunu üzerine saatlerce konuşabilirim. Ama kısa anlatmaya çalışayım:
1.	string bir soyutlamadır. Çünkü string beklentisi ile çalışan verileri soyutlar. Mesela memory içinde nasıl saklanacakları, nasıl okunacakları, diğer veriler ile nasıl etkileşime geçecekleri, operatörlere nasıl tepki verecekleri gibi tüm bu beklentilerin ortak kısmını ifade eder. Bunlar gibi farklı açılardan bir karakter dizisinden beklenenler string olarak soyutlanmıştır. Bunlara davranışsal soyutlama nedir. Çünkü farklı varlıkların ortak davranışlarının ele alınması ile ortaya çıkan soyutlamalar ile ilgilenir.
2.	hello bir soyutlamadır. Memory adresini soyutlar. Verini nasıl saklanması gerektiği ve nerede saklanacağı gibi adımları soyutlar. Unutmayın: Alt tarafta çalışan farklı olsalar bile tüm bu kodların bir amacı vardır ve o da hello değişkenin bir memory adresine dönüşmesi ve kendisinin diğer yerlerde referans gösterilmesidir, vs.
3.	= (eşit işareti) bir soyutlamadır. Bir verinin atanması adımlarını soyutlar.
4.	“world” bir soyutlamadır. Kendisini var eden tüm kodları soyutlar, kendisinin saklanması için kullanılan 010101 soyutlar, oluşturulma ve saklanma sürecini soyutlar.
Başka bir koda bakalım.
function createAccount(account){
  var eligableForCreation = account.age > 18 && account.country === "USA"
  if(eligableForCreation){
    this.pushAccountToCosmosDb(account);
  }else{
    console.log("account is not eligable for opening");
  }
}
Sizce createAccount() fonksiyonu ve eligableForCreation değişkeni bir abstraction mı? Evet. createAccount() içindeki tüm adımlar ilk bakışta birbirlerinden farklı gözükseler bile aslında ortak bir amaç uğrunda oradalar: Yeni bir hesap oluşturmak. Dolayısıyla amaçlarındaki ortaklığı alıp, diğer kısımları göz ardı etmenin adıdır createAccount() fonksiyonu. Bir ceketi oluşturan parçalar gibi. Benzer şekilde eligableForCreation değişkeni kendisine oluşturan parçaların ortak amacını temsil eder. Yaşın 18 den büyük olması ve yaşanılan ülkenin USA olması, hesabı açabilmek demektir.
Genelde davranışsal ve amaçsal soyutlamalar karşımıza çok çıkar bu tür kodlarda. Ama kalıtım girince, başka soyutlama katmanlarında, farklı soyutlama çeşitleri ortaya çıkabilir:
class Animal{
  public int Length {set;get;}
  public string Gender {get;set;}
}class Dog: Animal{
  public int TailLength {get;set;}
}class Dolphin: Animal{
  public string SpeedInWater {get;set;}
}
Yukarıda uydurduğum sınıflarda, Animal daha çok karakteristik bir abstraction sağlıyor. Köpek ve Yunus karaketlerinin daha specific kısımlarını göz ardı edip, her ikisinde de ortak olan uzunluk ve cinsiyet gibi kısımları ortaya sunuyor. Ama aşağıdaki örnekte daha çok davranısşal ve fonksiyonel bir abstraction göreceksiniz:
interface IAnimal{
  public void Move();
}class Dog: Animal{
  public void Run();
}class Dolphin: Animal{
  public void Swim();
}
Bunları yaparken, hitap ettiğiniz asıl kitle, bu sınıfları kullacak olan diğer insanlar. Arabalarda ki gaz ve fren gibi kısımlar ile soyutlanan binlerce parça, arabayı nasıl daha kolay kullanılabilir hale getirdiyse, yazılımda da abstraction benzer etkiyi hem sizin için hem de sınıflarınızı kullanacak diğer mühendisler için yapar. Eğer mühendisler, arabanın nasıl çalıştığını bildiklerinden dolayı, onları üretirken herkesi kendileri gibi düşünüyor olsalardı, o zaman araba süren insan sayısı şimdikinin sizce kaçta kaçı kadar olurdu? Benzer şekilde, eğer yazılımda, abstraction çok gelişmiş bir konsept olmasaydı, şu an çoğumuzun 010101 diye kod yazıyor olurduk. Ya da biraz daha ileri gidelim, assembly ile can çekişmek zorunda kalırdık.
Özetlemek gerekirse: Farklı kod parçalarının kompleks kısımlarını, sahip oldukları ortak davranışlar, amaçlar, karakteristik özellikler arkasında saklamak sayesinde daha anlaşılır ve kolay kullanılabilir kod yazmaktır abstraction.
Bir de Encapsulation vardı!
Abstraction dışarıdan bakan içindir demiştik. Encapsulation ise tam tersi. Encapsulation, motor üreticilerinin onu kaporta ve motor kapakları ile koruma içgüdüsüdür. Encapsulation evlerimizde ki kapı ve perdelerdir. Encapsulation beynimizi çevreleyen kafatasıdır. Encapsulation, sınıfımızı başkalarının yanlış kullanımlarımdan korumak için kontrolsüz değişime kapamaktır. Sınıfımızın içeriğini deterministic tutabilmek için koruruz onu. Aşağıda ki örneği bir inceleyin, yeterli olacaktır.
class AccountCreator{
  public int Age;
  private string _country;
  
  public void CreateAccount(Account account){
    this.Age = account.Age;
    // Simulate some long running task with Thread.Sleep
    Thread.Sleep(10000);
    this._country = account.Country;
    var accountEligible = CheckAge();
  } 
  
  private bool CheckAge(){
    if(_country == "USA"){
      this.Age++;
      return this.Age > 18;
    }
  }
}static void Main(string[] args){
  var accountCreator = new AccountCreator();
  var account = getAccountFromAzure();
  accountCreator.CreateAccount(account);
  // Hmmm, not sure what this Age field does, better to set it with something else...
  accountCreator.Age = 16;
  // Boom!
}

Apache Kafka	(GITHUB)  (test) 
kafka nedir, apache kafka nedir
Apache Kafka is an open-source stream-processing software platform developed by the Apache Software Foundation, written in Scala and Java. The project aims to provide a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds. Kafka can connect to external systems (for data import/export) via Kafka Connect and provides Kafka Streams, a Java stream processing library. Kafka uses a binary TCP-based protocol that is optimized for efficiency and relies on a "message set" abstraction that naturally groups messages together to reduce the overhead of the network roundtrip. This "leads to larger network packets, larger sequential disk operations, contiguous memory blocks [...] which allows Kafka to turn a bursty stream of random message writes into linear writes."[4]

go nedir, golang nedir

Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google[14] by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.[12] Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing,[6] and CSP-style concurrency.[15] The language is often referred to as "Golang" because of its domain name, golang.org, but the proper name is Go.[16]
There are two major implementations:
•	Google's self-hosting[17] compiler toolchain targeting multiple operating systems, mobile devices,[18] and WebAssembly.[19]
•	gccgo, a GCC frontend.[20][21]
A third-party transpiler GopherJS[22] compiles Go to JavaScript for front-end web development.

Smarty	(GITHUB)  (test)
Smarty nedir

Smarty is a template engine for PHP. More specifically, it facilitates a manageable way to separate application logic and content from its presentation. This is best described in a situation where the application programmer and the template designer play different roles, or in most cases are not the same person.
For example, let's say you are creating a web page that is displaying a newspaper article.
The article $headline, $tagline, $author and $body are content elements, they contain no information about how they will be presented. They are passed into Smarty by the application.
Then the template designer edits the templates and uses a combination of HTML tags and template tags to format the presentation of these variables with elements such as tables, div's, background colors, font sizes, style sheets, svg etc.
One day the programmer needs to change the way the article content is retrieved, ie a change in application logic. This change does not affect the template designer, the content will still arrive in the template exactly the same.
Likewise, if the template designer wants to completely redesign the templates, this would require no change to the application logic.
Therefore, the programmer can make changes to the application logic without the need to restructure templates, and the template designer can make changes to templates without breaking application logic.
One design goal of Smarty is the separation of business logic and presentation logic.
This means templates can certainly contain logic under the condition that it is for presentation only. Things such as including other templates, alternating table row colors, upper-casing a variable, looping over an array of data and displaying it are examples of presentation logic.
This does not mean however that Smarty forces a separation of business and presentation logic. Smarty has no knowledge of which is which, so placing business logic in the template is your own doing.
Also, if you desire no logic in your templates you certainly can do so by boiling the content down to text and variables only.

Some of Smarty's features:
It is extremely fast.
It is efficient since the PHP parser does the dirty work.
No template parsing overhead, only compiles once.
It is smart about recompiling only the template files that have changed.
You can easily create your own custom functions and variable modifiers, so the template language is extremely extensible.
Configurable template {delimiter} tag syntax, so you can use {$foo}, {{$foo}}, <!--{$foo}-->, etc.
The {if}..{elseif}..{else}..{/if} constructs are passed to the PHP parser, so the {if...} expression syntax can be as simple or as complex an evaluation as you like.
Allows unlimited nesting of sections, if's etc.
It is possible to embed PHP code right in your template files, although this may not be needed (nor recommended) since the engine is so customizable.
Built-in caching support
Arbitrary template sources
Custom cache handling functions

Apache Nutch	(GITHUB)  (test) 
Apache Nutch nedir
Apache Nutch is a highly extensible and scalable open source web crawler software project. Stemming from Apache Lucene, the project has diversified and now comprises two codebases, namely:
Nutch 1.x: A well matured, production ready crawler. 1.x enables fine grained configuration, relying on Apache Hadoop data structures, which are great for batch processing.
Nutch 2.x: An emerging alternative taking direct inspiration from 1.x, but which differs in one key area; storage is abstracted away from any specific underlying data store by using Apache Gora for handling object to persistent mappings. This means we can implement an extremely flexibile model/stack for storing everything (fetch time, status, content, parsed text, outlinks, inlinks, etc.) into a number of NoSQL storage solutions.
Being pluggable and modular of course has it's benefits, Nutch provides extensible interfaces such as Parse, Index and ScoringFilter's for custom implementations e.g. Apache Tika for parsing. Additionally, pluggable indexing exists for Apache Solr, Elastic Search, etc.

Nodejs nedir node.js nedir
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server- and client-side scripts.
Though .js is the standard filename extension for JavaScript code, the name "Node.js" doesn't refer to a particular file in this context and is merely the name of the product. Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).[7]
The Node.js distributed development project was previously governed by the Node.js Foundation,[8] and has now merged with the JS Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation, which is facilitated by the Linux Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.
Corporate users of Node.js software include GoDaddy,[10] Groupon,[11] IBM,[12] LinkedIn,[13][14] Microsoft,[15][16] Netflix,[17] PayPal,[18][19] Rakuten, SAP,[20] Voxer,[21] Walmart,[22] Yahoo!,[23] and Amazon Web Services.

Node.js, açık kaynaklı, sunucu tarafında çalışan ve ağ bağlantılı uygulamalar için geliştirilmiş bir çalıştırma ortamıdır (İng. runtime environment). Node.js uygulamaları genelde istemci tarafı betik dili olan JavaScript kullanılarak geliştirilir.
En önemli avantajı JavaScript'in sağladığı bloklamayan G/Ç (İng. non-blocking I/O) imkânıyla yüksek ölçeklenebilirliği (İng. scalability) ve yüksek veri aktarabilmesidir. Bu teknolojiler sık sık gerçek zamanlı Web uygulamalarında tercih edilmekle beraber kullanım alanı popülaritesiyle orantılı olarak genişlemiştir.
Node.js, Google V8 JavaScript motorunu kullanarak betik dilini yorumlar ve içerisinde standart olarak dağıtılan kütüphaneler sayesinde ek bir sunucu yazılımına (Apache HTTP Sunucusu, Nginx, IIS v.s.) gerek kalmadan uygulamanın Web sunucusu görevini görür.

Advantages of stateless programming	(GITHUB)  (test)
stateless nedir, stateles programming nedir
There are lots of advantages to stateless programming, not least of which is dramatically multithreaded and concurrent code. To put it bluntly, mutable state is enemy of multithreaded code. If values are immutable by default, programmers don't need to worry about one thread mutating the value of shared state between two threads, so it eliminates a whole class of multithreading bugs related to race conditions. Since there are no race conditions, there's no reason to use locks either, so immutability eliminates another whole class of bugs related to deadlocks as well.
That's the big reason why functional programming matters, and probably the best one for jumping on the functional programming train. There are also lots of other benefits, including simplified debugging (i.e. functions are pure and do not mutate state in other parts of an application), more terse and expressive code, less boilerplate code compared to languages which are heavily dependent on design patterns, and the compiler can more aggressively optimize your code.
-
The more pieces of your program are stateless, the more ways there are to put pieces together without having anything break. The power of the stateless paradigm lies not in statelessness (or purity) per se, but the ability it gives you to write powerful, reusable functions and combine them.
You can find a good tutorial with lots of examples in John Hughes's paper Why Functional Programming Matters (PDF).
You will be gobs more productive, especially if you pick a functional language that also has algebraic data types and pattern matching (Caml, SML, Haskell).
-
Without state, it is very easy to automatically parallelize your code (as CPUs are made with more and more cores this is very important).
-
Consider all the difficult bugs you've spent a long time debugging.
Now, how many of those bugs were due to "unintended interactions" between two separate components of a program? (Nearly all threading bugs have this form: races involving writing shared data, deadlocks, ... Additionally, it is common to find libraries that have some unexpected effect on global state, or read/write the registry/environment, etc.) I would posit that at least 1 in 3 'hard bugs' fall into this category.
Now if you switch to stateless/immutable/pure programming, all those bugs go away. You are presented with some new challenges instead (e.g. when you do want different modules to interact with the environment), but in a language like Haskell, those interactions get explicitly reified into the type system, which means you can just look at the type of a function and reason about the type of interactions it can have with the rest of the program.
That's the big win from 'immutability' IMO. In an ideal world, we'd all design terrific APIs and even when things were mutable, effects would be local and well-documented and 'unexpected' interactions would be kept to a minimum. In the real world, there are lots of APIs that interact with global state in myriad ways, and these are the source of the most pernicious bugs. Aspiring to statelessness is aspiring to be rid of unintended/implicit/behind-the-scenes interactions among components.

Concurrent Computing	 (GITHUB)  (test)
Concurrent Computing nedir
In concurrent computing, multiple calculations are made within overlapping time frames. It takes advantage of the concept that multiple threads or processes can make progress on a task without waiting for others to complete. This general approach to writing and executing computer programs is called concurrency.
Concurrent computing is different than synchronous (sequential) computing, where calculations are made one after the other, with each waiting for the previous to complete. It's not the same as parallel computing, where calculations are made simultaneously on separate processors.
The three main types of concurrent computing are threading, asynchrony, and preemptive multitasking. Each method has its own special precautions which must be taken to prevent race conditions, where multiple threads or processes access the same shared data in memory in improper order.

Technical Debt / Design Debt / Code Debt       (test)  (test)
Technical debt nedir
Technical debt (also known as design debt or code debt, but can be also related to other technical endeavors) is a concept in software development that reflects the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy (limited) solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.
As with monetary debt, if technical debt is not repaid, it can accumulate 'interest', making it harder to implement changes. Unaddressed technical debt increases software entropy. Technical debt is not necessarily a bad thing, and sometimes (e.g., as a proof-of-concept) is required to move projects forward. On the other hand, some experts claim that the "technical debt" metaphor tends to minimize the impact, which results in insufficient prioritization of the necessary work to correct it.
As a change is started on a codebase, there is often the need to make other coordinated changes in other parts of the codebase or documentation. Changes required that are not completed are considered debt, and until paid, will incur interest on top of interest, making it cumbersome to build a project. Although the term is used in software development primarily, it can also be applied to other professions.

Sequential Algorithm / Serial Algorithm (test)  (test)
Sequential Algorithm nedir, sequential nedir
In computer science, a sequential algorithm or serial algorithm is an algorithm that is executed sequentially – once through, from start to finish, without other processing executing – as opposed to concurrently or in parallel. The term is primarily used to contrast with concurrent algorithm or parallel algorithm; most standard computer algorithms are sequential algorithms, and not specifically identified as such, as sequentialness is a background assumption. Concurrency and parallelism are in general distinct concepts, but they often overlap – many distributed algorithms are both concurrent and parallel – and thus "sequential" is used to contrast with both, without distinguishing which one. If these need to be distinguished, the opposing pairs sequential/concurrent and serial/parallel may be used.

Parallel Computing / Paralel Hesaplama	 (GITHUB)  (test)
Parallel computing nedir
Parallel computing is a type of computation where many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously.[1] Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction-level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has long been employed in high-performance computing, but has gained broader interest due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling.[2] As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years,[3] parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form of multi-core processors.[4]
Parallel computing is closely related to concurrent computing—they are frequently used together, and often conflated, though the two are distinct: it is possible to have parallelism without concurrency (such as bit-level parallelism), and concurrency without parallelism (such as multitasking by time-sharing on a single-core CPU).[5][6] In parallel computing, a computational task is typically broken down into several, often many, very similar sub-tasks that can be processed independently and whose results are combined afterwards, upon completion. In contrast, in concurrent computing, the various processes often do not address related tasks; when they do, as is typical in distributed computing, the separate tasks may have a varied nature and often require some inter-process communication during execution.
Parallel computers can be roughly classified according to the level at which the hardware supports parallelism, with multi-core and multi-processor computers having multiple processing elements within a single machine, while clusters, MPPs, and grids use multiple computers to work on the same task. Specialized parallel computer architectures are sometimes used alongside traditional processors, for accelerating specific tasks.

In some cases parallelism is transparent to the programmer, such as in bit-level or instruction-level parallelism, but explicitly parallel algorithms, particularly those that use concurrency, are more difficult to write than sequential ones,[7] because concurrency introduces several new classes of potential software bugs, of which race conditions are the most common. Communication and synchronization between the different subtasks are typically some of the greatest obstacles to getting optimal parallel program performance.
A theoretical upper bound on the speed-up of a single program as a result of parallelization is given by Amdahl's law.

Bu fikir, problemlerin çözümünün ufak görev parçalarına bölünmesi ve bunların eş zamanlı olarak koordine edilmesine dayanır. Paralel hesaplama ile performans artar, büyük sorunlar daha az sürede çözülür ve bilimdeki gelişmeler paralel hesaplamaya gereksinim duyar.[1]

Paralel Hesaplama Sistemleri
Paralel işlemci terimi bazen paralel işlemeye elverişli birden fazla işlemci içeren bir bilgisayarı tanımlamak için kullanılır. Binlerce işlemci içeren sistemler güçlü paralel (massively parallel) sistemler olarak bilinir. Çok çekirdekli işlemciler de paralel hesaplama sistemleri için uygundur. Kullanılan işlemcilerin büyüklüğüne göre sistemler büyük taneli (large grain) ve küçük taneli (small grain) olarak ikiye ayrılır. PC tabanlı sistemler küçük taneli sistemlere örnek olarak verilebilir. 
Çok çeşitli paralel bilgisayar (işlemci) yapıları vardır. Bu çeşitler, işlemciler (işleme elemanı olarak adlandırılır-PE) arasındaki veya işlemci ve hafıza arasındaki bağlantıya göre belirlenir. Flynn, tüm işlemcilerin aynı zamanda aynı talimatları işlemelerine göre (tek talimat/çoklu veri-SIMD) veya her bir işlemcinin farklı talimatları (çoklu talimat/çoklu veri-MIMD) işlemesine göre paralel bilgisayarları sınıflandırır. Paralel işlemci makineleri simetrik (tüm işlemcilerin aynı seviyede olması) ve asimetrik (işlemcilerin bazı görevler için ayrılması ve önceliklerinin olması) çoklu işlemciler olarak ikiye ayrılır.
Performans & Fiyat
n adet paralel işlemciden oluşan bir sistem, n kat hızlı tek bir işlemciden daha az verimlidir fakat çok daha ucuzdur. Çok fazla hesaplama gerektiren, bitirilmesinde zaman kısıtları olan ve özellikle n adet thread’e bölünebilen görevler için paralel hesaplama mükemmel bir çözümdür. Aslında geçtiğimiz yıllarda, süperbilgisayar olarak bilinen yüksek performanslı hesaplama sistemleri paralel bir mimariye sahiptir.
Algoritmalar
Bir paralel hesaplamanın, sadece uygun donanımı satın alıp, bağlantılarını yapınca başarılı olacağı asla düşünülmemelidir. Kooperatif problem çözme şu sebepten dolayı zordur: Eğer bir insan bir çukuru bir dakikada kazıyorsa, 60 insanın bir çukuru bir saniyede kazması gerekir.
Pratikte lineer hızlanmayı (işlemci sayısıyla orantılı) başarmak çok zordur. Bunun nedeni, doğada birçok algoritma aslında sıralıdır (Amdahl yasası bunu bilimsel olarak açıklamıştır).
Ekstra işlemciler eklendikçe, bazı iş yükleri, boruhattı (pipeline) paralellik kullanarak belli bir noktaya kadar fayda sağlar. Bu sistem, bir fabrika montaj hattı yaklaşımı kullanarak işleri parçalar. Eğer iş n aşamaya bölünebiliyorsa ve bir ayrık değişken bir aşamadan diğer birine iletilebiliyorsa, en fazla n adet işlemci kullanılabilir. Bununla birlikte, en yavaş aşama diğer aşamaları da tutacaktır ve n işlemciyi tam performansta kullanmak pek mümkün olmayacaktır.
Pek çok algoritma, paralel donanımın kullanımını daha verimli yapmak için tekrar tasarlanmalıdır. Tek işlemcili sistemlerde iyi çalışan programlar, paralel sistemlerde aynı performansı vermeyebilir. Aynı programın çoklu kopyaları, birbirlerini etkileyebilirler (aynı anda aynı hafıza adresine yazma/okuma yapma). Bu yüzden paralel sistemlerde dikkatli programlama yapılması gerekir.
Thread'ler arası iletişim
Paralel bilgisayarlar, teorik olarak, Paralel Rastgele Erişim Makineleri (PRAM) olarak modellenir. PRAM modeli, hesaplama bileşenleri arasındaki bağlantı masraflarını yok sayar fakat bununla beraber pek çok problem için paralel çözülebilirlik desteği sunar. Gerçekte ara bağlantılar çok hayati rol oynar.
İşlemciler bir problemi iş birliği ile çözerken birbirleriyle haberleşmek durumundadırlar veya işleri dağıtan ve sonuçları toplayan bir başka işlemcinin kontrolü altında birbirlerinden tamamen bağımsız çalışabilirler.
Bir paralel bilgisayardaki işlemciler birbirleriyle pek çok çeşitli yöntemler ile haberleşirler. Bunlar: paylaşılmış hafıza, sürgü (crossbar), paylaşılmış bir veri yolu ya da yıldız, halka, ağaç, hiperküp, şişman hiperküp, n boyutlu ağ (mesh) gibi çok sayıda çeşitli ağ topolojileri vs. olabilir. Paralel bilgisayarlar, birbirleriyle doğrudan bağlantılı olmayan düğümlerde mesajların değişimi için bazı yönlendirme tekniklerine ihtiyaç duyarlar. Büyük ölçekli çoklu işlemci makinelerinde haberleşme ortamı hiyerarşik biçimdedir. Benzer şekilde, hafıza her bir işlemciye özgü, belli sayıdaki işlemciler için paylaşımlı veya tümüyle paylaşımlı olabilir.

Paralel bilgisayar yaklaşımları şu şekildedir:
Çokluişleme (multiprocessing)
Bilgisayar kümelemesi
Paralel süperbilgisayarlar
Dağıtık hesaplama
NUMA, SMP ve massively paralel sistemler
Izgara (grid) hesaplama
Paralel Programlama
Paralel bilgisayarlarda programlama için işletim sistemi seviyesinde ve programlama dili seviyesinde pek çok yazılım sistemi geliştirilmiştir. Bu sistemler, problemin parçalara bölümlenmesini ve işlemcilere atanmasını sağlayan çeşitli mekanizmalar içermelidir. Dolaylı paralellik (implicit parallelism) derleyici ya da diğer programın problemi bölümlemesi ve işlemcilere otomatik olarak atamasıdır. Dolaysız paralellik (explicit parallelism) ise programcının problemin nasıl bölümleneceğini bildirmesidir. Şu an pek çok paralel işleme derleyici uygulamaları tek-katmanlı parallelliği desteklemektedir. Çok-katmanlı paralellik de paralel çalışan thread’ler daha fazla paralellik için daha da bölünürler. Semaphore ve monitor adı verilen senkronizasyon yapıları ile işlemlerin kaynakları paylaşımında bir anlaşmazlık olması durumu engellenmiştir.
Yük dengeleme, ağır yük ile çalışan işlemciden bazı görevleri daha hafif yük ile çalışan işlemcilere taşıyarak hepsinin aynı meşguliyette olmasını sağlar.
Bazı insanlar paralel programlamayı, eş zamanlı (concurrent) programlama ile eş anlamlı kabul ederler. Bazıları da kesin bir çizgiyle ayrırırlar. Paralel programlama, işlemler arasında iyi tanımlanmış iletişim yapıları kullanan ve verimi artırmaya yönelik işlemlerinin paralel işlenmesini sağlayan bir yapıdır. Eş zamanlı (concurrent) programlama, performanstan ziyade başka nedenlerden dolayı eş zamanlı işlemler arasında yeni iletişim tekniklerine dayanan bir yapıdadır. İşlemler arası iletişim genelde paylaşımlı hafıza veya mesaj geçirme tekniği ile yapılır.

İyi bilinen paralel yazılım problem kümeleri
Cansıkıcı (Embarrassingly) paralel: Bir birinden bağımsız alt görevler içeren, kolay uygulanabilen problemlerdir. Daha çok dağıtık hesaplama için uygundurlar. Mesela büyük bir grafiğin render edilmesi veya seti@home gibi projeler buna örnek verilebilir.
Büyük uğraştırıcı (grand challenge) problemler: Genelde çözülmesi çok zor olan problemlerdir. Ör: uygulamalı akışkanlar dinamiği, ekosistem simülasyonları, biyomedikal görüntüleme ve biyomekanik, moleküler biyoloji , kavrama, nükleer güç ve silah simulasyonları vs.
Paralel programlama modelleri

Paralel modeller çok farklı şekillerde uyarlanırlar: klasik sıralı dillerden çağrılan kütüphaneler şeklinde, dil uzantıları şeklinde ya da tamamen yeni işleme modelleriyle. Bu modeller kabaca ikiye ayrılırlar: paylaşımlı hafıza sistemleri ve dağıtık hafıza sistemleri. Günümüzde bu iki sistem arasındaki çizgi oldukça bulanıklaşmıştır.

What is Parallel Computing?
Parallel computing is a programming method that harnesses the power of multiple processors at once. Once of concern only to programmers of large supercomputers, modern computers now almost always have multi-core processors.
Typical programming assumes that computers execute one operation at a time in the sequence specified by your program code. At any time step, the computer’s Central Processing Unit (CPU) core will be working on one particular operation from the sequence. We will call this traditional style of computing sequential.
In contrast, with parallel computing we will now be dealing with multiple CPU cores that each are independently working on a sequence of instructions. This can allow us to do much more at once, and therefore get results more quickly than if only running an equivalent sequential program. The act of changing sequential code to parallel code is called parallelization.
Even when coming to the world’s largest supercomputer, running existing sequential code will not show a big difference in performance. Today’s fast computers are defined by the number of CPU cores, not by individual CPU core speed. When you run code on a larger server then you need to ensure that you are effectively using the multiple cores that are available.
Why use Parallel Computing?
Parallel computing, even on a smaller scale, has become more popular over the last decade. Before this time, the speed of CPUs was continually increasing. The solution to a computer running too slowly was often to purchase a newer, faster computer.
This continual increase in computer performance is often termed Moore’s Law. Moore was a cofounder of Intel and starting in the 1960s he predicted that the performance of computer processors would double every 18 months. This was indeed true for many decades.
The increasing capability in computer processors drove ever faster processors. However, faster processors are no longer feasible since manufacturers have come up against the physical limitations of CPU manufacturing. Instead, chip manufacturers have refocused on multi-core chips. Instead of trying to create faster processor cores, they are making more cores in one physical processor chip. The laptop or desktop you are working on now probably has around 4 cores in it. The servers we use in Carleton’s Research and Development Cloud can have up to 32 cores. And even more cores exist elsewhere on clusters, where programs are written that span multiple computers across a local network.

Parallel Algorithm	 (GITHUB)  (test)
Parallel algorithm nedir

In computer science, a parallel algorithm, as opposed to a traditional serial algorithm, is an algorithm which can do multiple operations in a given time. It has been a tradition of computer science to describe serial algorithms in abstract machine models, often the one known as Random-access machine. Similarly, many computer science researchers have used a so-called parallel random-access machine (PRAM) as a parallel abstract machine (shared-memory).
 
Many parallel algorithms are executed concurrently – though in general concurrent algorithms are a distinct concept – and thus these concepts are often conflated, with which aspect of an algorithm is parallel and which is concurrent not being clearly distinguished. Further, non-parallel, non-concurrent algorithms are often referred to as "sequential algorithms", by contrast with concurrent algorithms.
Parallelizability
Algorithms vary significantly in how parallelizable they are, ranging from easily parallelizable to completely unparallelizable. Further, a given problem may accommodate different algorithms, which may be more or less parallelizable.
Some problems are easy to divide up into pieces in this way – these are called embarrassingly parallel problems. Examples include many algorithms to solve Rubik's Cubes and find values which result in a given hash.[citation needed]
Some problems cannot be split up into parallel portions, as they require the results from a preceding step to effectively carry on with the next step – these are called inherently serial problems. Examples include iterative numerical methods, such as Newton's method, iterative solutions to the three-body problem, and most of the available algorithms to compute pi (π).[citation needed] Some sequential algorithms can be converted into parallel algorithms using automatic parallelization.
Motivation
Parallel algorithms on individual devices have become more common since the early 2000s because of substantial improvements in multiprocessing systems and the rise of multi-core processors. Up until the end of 2004, single-core processor performance rapidly increased via frequency scaling, and thus it was easier to construct a computer with a single fast core than one with many slower cores with the same throughput, so multicore systems were of more limited use. Since 2004 however, frequency scaling hit a wall, and thus multicore systems have become more widespread, making parallel algorithms of more general use.
Issues
Communication
The cost or complexity of serial algorithms is estimated in terms of the space (memory) and time (processor cycles) that they take. Parallel algorithms need to optimize one more resource, the communication between different processors. There are two ways parallel processors communicate, shared memory or message passing.
Shared memory processing needs additional locking for the data, imposes the overhead of additional processor and bus cycles, and also serializes some portion of the algorithm.
Message passing processing uses channels and message boxes but this communication adds transfer overhead on the bus, additional memory need for queues and message boxes and latency in the messages. Designs of parallel processors use special buses like crossbar so that the communication overhead will be small but it is the parallel algorithm that decides the volume of the traffic.
If the communication overhead of additional processors outweighs the benefit of adding another processor, one encounters parallel slowdown.
Load balancing
Another problem with parallel algorithms is ensuring that they are suitably load balanced, by ensuring that load (overall work) is balanced, rather than input size being balanced. For example, checking all numbers from one to a hundred thousand for primality is easy to split amongst processors; however, if the numbers are simply divided out evenly (1–1,000, 1,001–2,000, etc.), the amount of work will be unbalanced, as smaller numbers are easier to process by this algorithm (easier to test for primality), and thus some processors will get more work to do than the others, which will sit idle until the loaded processors complete.
Distributed algorithms
A subtype of parallel algorithms, distributed algorithms are algorithms designed to work in cluster computing and distributed computing environments, where additional concerns beyond the scope of "classical" parallel algorithms need to be addressed.

Symmetric multiprocessing / SMP	 (GITHUB)  (test)
Symmetric multiprocessing nedir
Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) involves a multiprocessor computer hardware and software architecture where two or more identical processors are connected to a single, shared main memory, have full access to all input and output devices, and are controlled by a single operating system instance that treats all processors equally, reserving none for special purposes. Most multiprocessor systems today use an SMP architecture. In the case of multi-core processors, the SMP architecture applies to the cores, treating them as separate processors.
Professor John D. Kubiatowicz considers traditionally SMP systems to contain processors without caches.[1] Culler and Pal-Singh in their 1998 book "Parallel Computer Architecture: A Hardware/Software Approach" mention: "The term SMP is widely used but causes a bit of confusion. [...] The more precise description of what is intended by SMP is a shared memory multiprocessor where the cost of accessing a memory location is the same for all processors; that is, it has uniform access costs when the access actually is to memory. If the location is cached, the access will be faster, but cache access times and memory access times are the same on all processors."
SMP systems are tightly coupled multiprocessor systems with a pool of homogeneous processors running independently of each other. Each processor, executing different programs and working on different sets of data, has the capability of sharing common resources (memory, I/O device, interrupt system and so on) that are connected using a system bus or a crossbar.
Design
SMP systems have centralized shared memory called main memory (MM) operating under a single operating system with two or more homogeneous processors. Usually each processor has an associated private high-speed memory known as cache memory (or cache) to speed up the main memory data access and to reduce the system bus traffic.
Processors may be interconnected using buses, crossbar switches or on-chip mesh networks. The bottleneck in the scalability of SMP using buses or crossbar switches is the bandwidth and power consumption of the interconnect among the various processors, the memory, and the disk arrays. Mesh architectures avoid these bottlenecks, and provide nearly linear scalability to much higher processor counts at the sacrifice of programmability:
Serious programming challenges remain with this kind of architecture because it requires two distinct modes of programming; one for the CPUs themselves and one for the interconnect between the CPUs. A single programming language would have to be able to not only partition the workload, but also comprehend the memory locality, which is severe in a mesh-based architecture.
SMP systems allow any processor to work on any task no matter where the data for that task is located in memory, provided that each task in the system is not in execution on two or more processors at the same time. With proper operating system support, SMP systems can easily move tasks between processors to balance the workload efficiently.

Parallel Operating Systems	 (GITHUB)  (test)
Parallel Operating Systems nedir
Parallel operating systems are the interface between parallel computers (or computer systems) and the applications (parallel or not) that are executed on them. They translate the hardware’s capabilities into concepts usable by programming languages.
Great diversity marked the beginning of parallel architectures and their operating systems. This diversity has since been reduced to a small set of dominating configurations: symmetric multiprocessors running commodity applications and operating systems (UNIX and Windows NT) and multicomputers running custom kernels and parallel applications. Additionally, there is some (mostly experimental) work done towards the exploitation of the shared memory paradigm on top of networks of workstations or personal computers.
In this chapter, we discuss the operating system components that are essential to support parallel systems and the central concepts surrounding their operation: scheduling, synchronization, multi-threading, inter-process communication, memory management and fault tolerance.
Currently, SMP computers are the most widely used multiprocessors. Users find it a very interesting model to have a computer, which, although it derives its processing power from a set of processors, does not require any changes to applications and only minor changes to the operating system. Furthermore, the most popular parallel programming languages have been ported to SMP architectures enabling also the execution of demanding parallel applications on these machines.
However, users who want to exploit parallel processing to the fullest use those same parallel programming languages on top of NORMA computers. These multicomputers with fast interconnects are the ideal hardware support for message passing parallel applications. The surviving commercial models with NORMA architectures are very expensive machines, which one will find running calculus intensive applications, such as weather forecasting or fluid dynamics modelling.
We also discuss some of the experiments that have been made both in hardware (DASH, Alewife) and in software systems (TreadMarks, Shasta) to deal with the scalability issues of maintaining consistency in shared-memory systems and to prove their applicability on a large-scale.

Primality Test   (GITHUB)  (test)
Primality Test nedir, primality nedir
A primality test is an algorithm for determining whether an input number is prime. Among other fields of mathematics, it is used for cryptography. Unlike integer factorization, primality tests do not generally give prime factors, only stating whether the input number is prime or not. Factorization is thought to be a computationally difficult problem, whereas primality testing is comparatively easy (its running time is polynomial in the size of the input). Some primality tests prove that a number is prime, while others like Miller–Rabin prove that a number is composite. Therefore, the latter might more accurately be called compositeness tests instead of primality tests.

Granularity / Grain Size (test)  (test)
Granularity nedir
In parallel computing, granularity (or grain size) of a task is a measure of the amount of work (or computation) which is performed by that task.[1]
Another definition of granularity takes into account the communication overhead between multiple processors or processing elements. It defines granularity as the ratio of computation time to communication time, wherein, computation time is the time required to perform the computation of a task and communication time is the time required to exchange data between processors.[2]
Granularity = Computation time / Communication time
 
Granularity is usually measured in terms of the number of instructions executed in a particular task.[1] Alternately, granularity can also be specified in terms of the execution time of a program, combining the computation time and communication time. 
Types of parallelism
Depending on the amount of work which is performed by a parallel task, parallelism can be classified into three categories: fine-grained, medium-grained and coarse-grained parallelism.
Fine-grained parallelism
In fine-grained parallelism, a program is broken down to a large number of small tasks. These tasks are assigned individually to many processors. The amount of work associated with a parallel task is low and the work is evenly distributed among the processors. Hence, fine-grained parallelism facilitates load balancing. 
As each task processes less data, the number of processors required to perform the complete processing is high. This in turn, increases the communication and synchronization overhead.
Fine-grained parallelism is best exploited in architectures which support fast communication. Shared memory architecture which has a low communication overhead is most suitable for fine-grained parallelism.
It is difficult for programmers to detect parallelism in a program, therefore, it is usually the compilers' responsibility to detect fine-grained parallelism.[1]
An example of a fine-grained system (from outside the parallel computing domain) is the system of neurons in our brain.[4]
Connection Machine (CM-2) and J-Machine are examples of fine-grain parallel computers that have grain size in the range of 4-5 μs.[1]
Coarse-grained parallelism
In coarse-grained parallelism, a program is split into large tasks. Due to this, a large amount of computation takes place in processors. This might result in load imbalance, wherein certain tasks process the bulk of the data while others might be idle. Further, coarse-grained parallelism fails to exploit the parallelism in the program as most of the computation is performed sequentially on a processor. The advantage of this type of parallelism is low communication and synchronization overhead.
Message-passing architecture takes a long time to communicate data among processes which makes it suitable for coarse-grained parallelism.[1]
Cray Y-MP is an example of coarse-grained parallel computer which has a grain size of about 20s.[1]
Medium-grained parallelism
Medium-grained parallelism is used relatively to fine-grained and coarse-grained parallelism. Medium-grained parallelism is a compromise between fine-grained and coarse-grained parallelism, where we have task size and communication time greater than fine-grained parallelism and lower than coarse-grained parallelism. Most general-purpose parallel computers fall in this category.[4]
Intel iPSC is an example of medium-grained parallel computer which has a grain size of about 10ms.[1]
Example
Consider a 10*10 image that needs to be processed, given that, processing of the 100 pixels is independent of each other.

Fine-grained parallelism: Assume there are 100 processors that are responsible for processing the 10*10 image. Ignoring the communication overhead, the 100 processors can process the 10*10 image in 1 clock cycle. Each processor is working on 1 pixel of the image and then communicates the output to other processors. This is an example of fine-grained parallelism.
Medium-grained parallelism: Consider that there are 25 processors processing the 10*10 image. The processing of the image will now take 4 clock cycles. This is an example of medium-grained parallelism.
Coarse-grained parallelism: Further, if we reduce the processors to 2, then the processing will take 50 clock cycles. Each processor need to process 50 elements which increases the computation time, but the communication overhead decreases as the number of processors which share data decreases. This case illustrates coarse-grained parallelism.
Fine-grain : Pseudocode for 100 processors	Medium-grain : Pseudocode for 25 processors	Coarse-grain : Pseudocode for 2 processors
void main()
{
  switch (Processor_ID)
  {
    case 1: Compute element 1; break;
    case 2: Compute element 2; break;
    case 3: Compute element 3; break;
    .
    .
    .
    .
    case 100: Compute element 100; 
              break;
  }
}
	void main()
{
  switch (Processor_ID)
  {
    case 1: Compute elements 1-4; break;
    case 2: Compute elements 5-8; break;
    case 3: Compute elements 9-12; break;
    .
    .
    case 25: Compute elements 97-100; 
             break;
  }
}
	void main()
{
  switch (Processor_ID)
  {
    case 1: Compute elements 1-50; 
            break;
    case 2: Compute elements 51-100; 
            break;
  }
}

Computation time - 1 clock cycle	Computation time - 4 clock cycles	Computation time - 50 clock cycles
Levels of parallelism
Granularity is closely tied to the level of processing. A program can be broken down into 4 levels of parallelism -
Instruction level.
Loop level
Sub-routine level and
Program-level
The highest amount of parallelism is achieved at instruction level, followed by loop-level parallelism. At instruction and loop level, fine-grained parallelism is achieved. Typical grain size at instruction-level is 20 instructions, while the grain-size at loop-level is 500 instructions.[1]
At the sub-routine (or procedure) level the grain size is typically a few thousand instructions. Medium-grained parallelism is achieved at sub-routine level.[1]
At program-level, parallel execution of programs takes place. Granularity can be in the range of tens of thousands of instructions.[1] Coarse-grained parallelism is used at this level.
The below table shows the relationship between levels of parallelism, grain size and degree of parallelism
Levels	Grain Size	Parallelism
Instruction level	Fine	Highest
Loop level	Fine	Moderate
Sub-routine level	Medium	Moderate
Program level	Coarse	Least
Impact of granularity on performance
Granularity affects the performance of parallel computers. Using fine grains or small tasks results in more parallelism and hence increases the speedup. However, synchronization overhead, scheduling strategies etc. can negatively impact the performance of fine-grained tasks. Increasing parallelism alone cannot give the best performance.[5]
In order to reduce the communication overhead, granularity can be increased. Coarse grained tasks have less communication overhead but they often cause load imbalance. Hence optimal performance is achieved between the two extremes of fine-grained and coarse-grained parallelism.[6]
Various studies[5][7][8] have proposed their solution to help determine the best granularity to aid parallel processing. Finding the best grain size, depends on a number of factors and varies greatly from problem-to-problem.

White-box Testing / Clear Box Testing / Glass Box Testing, Transparent Box Testing / Structural Testing	 (GITHUB)   (test)

white box testing nedir, white box nedir
White-box testing (also known as clear box testing, glass box testing, transparent box testing, and structural testing) is a method of software testing that tests internal structures or workings of an application, as opposed to its functionality (i.e. black-box testing). In white-box testing an internal perspective of the system, as well as programming skills, are used to design test cases. The tester chooses inputs to exercise paths through the code and determine the expected outputs. This is analogous to testing nodes in a circuit, e.g. in-circuit testing (ICT). White-box testing can be applied at the unit, integration and system levels of the software testing process. Although traditional testers tended to think of white-box testing as being done at the unit level, it is used for integration and system testing more frequently today. It can test paths within a unit, paths between units during integration, and between subsystems during a system–level test. Though this method of test design can uncover many errors or problems, it has the potential to miss unimplemented parts of the specification or missing requirements. Where white-box testing is design-driven,[1] that is, driven exclusively by agreed specifications of how each component of software is required to behave (as in DO-178C and ISO 26262 processes) then white-box test techniques can accomplish assessment for unimplemented or missing requirements.
White-box test design techniques include the following code coverage criteria:
•	Control flow testing
•	Data flow testing
•	Branch testing
•	Statement coverage
•	Decision coverage
•	Modified condition/decision coverage
•	Prime path testing
•	Path testing

Overview
White-box testing is a method of testing the application at the level of the source code. These test cases are derived through the use of the design techniques mentioned above: control flow testing, data flow testing, branch testing, path testing, statement coverage and decision coverage as well as modified condition/decision coverage. White-box testing is the use of these techniques as guidelines to create an error-free environment by examining all code. These white-box testing techniques are the building blocks of white-box testing, whose essence is the careful testing of the application at the source code level to reduce hidden errors later on.[2] These different techniques exercise every visible path of the source code to minimize errors and create an error-free environment. The whole point of white-box testing is the ability to know which line of the code is being executed and being able to identify what the correct output should be. 

Levels
1.	Unit testing. White-box testing is done during unit testing to ensure that the code is working as intended, before integration happens with previously tested code. White-box testing during unit testing potentially catches many defects early on and aids in addressing defects that happen later on after the code is integrated with the rest of the application and therefore reduces the impacts of errors later in development.[2]
2.	Integration testing. White-box testing at this level is written to test the interactions of interfaces with each other. The unit level testing made sure that each code was tested and working accordingly in an isolated environment and integration examines the correctness of the behaviour in an open environment through the use of white-box testing for any interactions of interfaces that are known to the programmer.[2]
3.	Regression testing. White-box testing during regression testing is the use of recycled white-box test cases at the unit and integration testing levels.[2]

Basic procedure
White-box testing's basic procedures require the tester to have an in-depth knowledge of the source code being tested. The programmer must have a deep understanding of the application to know what kinds of test cases to create so that every visible path is exercised for testing. Once the source code is understood then the source code can be analyzed for test cases to be created. The following are the three basic steps that white-box testing takes in order to create test cases:
1.	Input involves different types of requirements, functional specifications, detailed designing of documents, proper source code and security specifications.[citation needed] This is the preparation stage of white-box testing to lay out all of the basic information.
2.	Processing involves performing risk analysis to guide whole testing process, proper test plan, execute test cases and communicate results.[citation needed] This is the phase of building test cases to make sure they thoroughly test the application the given results are recorded accordingly.
3.	Output involves preparing final report that encompasses all of the above preparations and results.

Advantages
White-box testing is one of the two biggest testing methods used today. It has several major advantages:
1.	Side effects of having the knowledge of the source code is beneficial to thorough testing.[citation needed]
2.	Optimization of code becomes easy as inconspicuous bottlenecks are exposed.[citation needed]
3.	Gives the programmer introspection because developers carefully describe any new implementation.[citation needed]
4.	Provides traceability of tests from the source, thereby allowing future changes to the source to be easily captured in the newly added or modified tests.[3]
5.	Easy to automate.[4]
6.	Provides clear, engineering-based rules for when to stop testing.
 
Disadvantages
Although white-box testing has great advantages, it is not perfect and contains some disadvantages:
1.	White-box testing brings complexity to testing because the tester must have knowledge of the program, or the test team needs to have at least one very good programmer who can understand the program at the code level. White-box testing requires a programmer with a high level of knowledge due to the complexity of the level of testing that needs to be done.[citation needed]
2.	On some occasions, it is not realistic to be able to test every single existing condition of the application and some conditions will be untested.[citation needed]
3.	The tests focus on the software as it exists, and missing functionality may not be discovered.
4.	The resulting test can be fragile because they are tightly coupled to the specific implementation of the thing being tested. The code under test could be rewritten to implement the same functionality in a different way that invalidates the assumptions baked into the test. This could result in tests that fail unnecessarily or, in the worst case, tests that now give false positives and mask errors in the code.

Modern view
A more modern view is that the dichotomy between white-box testing and black-box testing has blurred and is becoming less relevant. Whereas "white-box" originally meant using the source code, and black-box meant using requirements, tests are now derived from many documents at various levels of abstraction. The real point is that tests are usually designed from an abstract structure such as the input space, a graph, or logical predicates, and the question is what level of abstraction we derive that abstract structure from.[4] That can be the source code, requirements, input space descriptions, or one of dozens of types of design models. Therefore, the "white-box / black-box" distinction is less important and the terms are less relevant.[citation needed]

Hacking
In penetration testing, white-box testing refers to a method where a white hat hacker has full knowledge of the system being attacked. The goal of a white-box penetration test is to simulate a malicious insider who has knowledge of and possibly basic credentials for the target system.

Tell Don’t Ask	(GITHUB)  (test)
Tell Don’t Ask nedir, tell, don’t ask nedir
There is a great principle in object-oriented programming which says: "Tell, Don't Ask".
This principle tells that we should not ask object about their state, make decision and only then tell them what to do. Rather we should send commands.
There is a good quote about that:
Procedural code gets information then makes decisions. Object-oriented code tells objects to do things.
-- Alec Sharp
There are couple good examples in this article. Let's check the first one:
<% if current_user.admin? %>
  <%= current_user.admin_welcome_message %>
<% else %>
  <%= current_user.user_welcome_message %>
<% end %>
This code is bad. We ask current_user if he is an admin and according to answer decide which method to call.
Another bad thing that logic which decides which message to send lives outside of current_user object. So if we want to show that message in couple places - we will have to repeat if..else statement in each place. Or if we need to change that logic at some moment - we will have to do that in couple places as well. That breaks Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) rule.
If we apply "Tell, Don't Ask" principle, that code would look like this:
<%= current_user.welcome_message %>
Logic which checks if user is an admin should live in welcome_message method.
Let's check another example:
class Wallet

  attr_accessor :balance

  def initialize(balance)
    @balance = balance
  end

end

class PaymentService

  attr_reader :wallet

  def initialize(wallet)
    @wallet = wallet
  end

  def debit(amount)
    if wallet.balance < amount
      raise "Not enough funds"
    else
      wallet.balance -= amount
    end
  end

  def credit(amount)
    wallet.balance += amount
  end
end
In this example class Wallet just stores balance variable. PaymentService class contains logic which asking wallet for a balance:
  def debit(amount)
    if wallet.balance < amount
      raise "Not enough funds"
    else
      wallet.balance -= amount
    end
  end
That's not good because that logic belongs to wallet. And again, if you decide to debit money in other part of your app you will have to check balance again and again.
Let's rewrite that code following "Tell, Don't ask principle":
class Wallet

  attr_accessor :balance

  def initialize(balance)
    @balance = balance
  end

  def debit(amount)
    raise "Not enogh funds" if balance < amount
    self.balance -= amount
  end

  def credit(amount)
    self.balance += amount
  end

end

class PaymentService

  attr_reader :wallet

  def initialize(wallet)
    @wallet = wallet
  end

  def debit(amount)
    wallet.debit(amount)
  end

  def credit(amount)
    wallet.credit(amount)
  end
end
Now code looks much better. Class Wallet contains all required logic and PaymentService just sends command to wallet: debit!
If we get new requirements for wallet behaviour - we know exactly where that logic lives - it's a Wallet class.
Follow "Tell Don't Ask" principle. Send commands to objects and you will get clean code which is easy to maintain and flexible enough to add new features.

Başka bir kişiden örnek:
The Tell, Don’t Ask (TDA) principle suggests that it is better to issue an object a command do perform some operation or logic, rather than to query its state and then take some action as a result. It is related to the Flags Over Objects antipattern as well as the Anemic Domain Model antipattern. You can easily spot violations of TDA in code that queries or uses several properties of an object in order to perform some calculation. This is especially problematic when the same kind of calculation is done in many places (violating the Don’t Repeat Yourself principle), but can represent a design deficiency even if it only occurs in one location in the current codebase.

        {
            if (cpuMonitor.Value > 90)
            {

            {
                // alert
            }
        }
    } 
}
 
// Refactored Further
public class CpuMonitor
{
    private readonly int _alertThreshold;
    private readonly Action<CpuMonitor> _alertAction;
 
    public CpuMonitor(int alertThreshold, Action<CpuMonitor> alertAction)
    {
        _alertThreshold = alertThreshold;
        _alertAction = alertAction;
    }
 
    public int Value { get; set; }
    public bool ExceedsThreshold { get { return Value >= _alertThreshold; } }
 
    public void Sample()
    {
        if (ExceedsThreshold)
        {
            _alertAction(this);
        }
    }
}
 
public class Client
{
    public void AlertService(List<CpuMonitor> cpuMonitors)
    {
        foreach (var cpuMonitor in cpuMonitors)
        {
            cpuMonitor.Sample();
        }
    }
}
In the example above, the first refactoring looks at the magic number representing the alert threshold, and moves this concept into the monitor itself. This might not be worth correcting if this client code were the only instance of this behavior, but if you find repetition in this kind of code, follow the Don’t Repeat Yourself principle and consolidate it into a class (in this case, CpuMonitor). The initial refactoring is still querying each monitor and then performing some action based on that query, and so is still asking, not telling. The final refactoring moves the responsibility for sending alerts into the monitor itself, while still avoiding tightly coupling it to any particular alert implementation. In this way, monitor remains loosely coupled from whatever alert implementation the system might have in place.
It’s not necessary to follow the “don’t ask” part of this principle to the extreme of eliminating all access to objects’ state. In general, it’s ok to query an object for its state, provided the information isn’t being used to make a decision related to the object. If it is, then that decision and any corresponding behavior should most likely be moved within the object itself. Another consequence of violating TDA is that often magic numbers or business rules end up sprinkled throughout code that references object state, rather than embedded within the object itself or passed into the object as a defined and well-named construct (such as CpuAlertThreshold in the example above).

Unit Testing	 (GITHUB)  (test)
Unit testing nedir
UNIT TESTING is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected. Unit Testing is done during the development (coding phase) of an application by the developers. Unit Tests isolate a section of code and verify its correctness. A unit may be an individual function, method, procedure, module, or object.
In SDLC, STLC, V Model, Unit testing is first level of testing done before integration testing. 
Unit testing is a WhiteBox testing technique that is usually performed by the developer. Though, in a practical world due to time crunch or reluctance of developers to tests, QA engineers also do unit testing.
Why Unit Testing?
Unit Testing is important because software developers sometimes try saving time doing minimal unit testing and this is myth because inappropriate unit testing leads to high cost Defect fixing during System Testing, Integration Testing and even Beta Testing after application is built. If proper unit testing is done in early development, then it saves time and money in the end.
Here, are the key reasons to perform unit testing:
 
Unit Testing Levels
1.	Unit tests help to fix bugs early in the development cycle and save costs.
2.	It helps the developers to understand the code base and enables them to make changes quickly
3.	Good unit tests serve as project documentation
4.	Unit tests help with code re-use. Migrate both your code and your tests to your new project. Tweak the code until the tests run again.
How to do Unit Testing
In order to do Unit Testing, developers write a section of code to test a specific function in software application. Developers can also isolate this function to test more rigorously which reveals unnecessary dependencies between function being tested and other units so the dependencies can be eliminated. Developers generally use UnitTest framework to develop automated test cases for unit testing.

Unit Testing is of two types:
Manual
Automated
Unit testing is commonly automated but may still be performed manually. Software Engineering does not favor one over the other but automation is preferred. A manual approach to unit testing may employ a step-by-step instructional document.

Under the automated approach-
A developer writes a section of code in the application just to test the function. They would later comment out and finally remove the test code when the application is deployed.
A developer could also isolate the function to test it more rigorously. This is a more thorough unit testing practice that involves copy and paste of code to its own testing environment than its natural environment. Isolating the code helps in revealing unnecessary dependencies between the code being tested and other units or data spaces in the product. These dependencies can then be eliminated.
A coder generally uses a UnitTest Framework to develop automated test cases. Using an automation framework, the developer codes criteria into the test to verify the correctness of the code. During execution of the test cases, the framework logs failing test cases. Many frameworks will also automatically flag and report, in summary, these failed test cases. Depending on the severity of a failure, the framework may halt subsequent testing.
The workflow of Unit Testing is 1) Create Test Cases 2) Review/Rework 3) Baseline 4) Execute Test Cases.
Unit Testing Techniques
The Unit Testing Techniques are mainly categorized into three parts which are Black box testing that involves testing of user interface along with input and output, White box testing that involves testing the functional behaviour of the software application and Gray box testing that is used to execute test suites, test methods, test cases and performing risk analysis.

Code coverage techniques used in Unit Testing are listed below:
Statement Coverage
Decision Coverage
Branch Coverage
Condition Coverage
Finite State Machine Coverage
For more in refer https://www.guru99.com/code-coverage.html

Unit Testing Example: Mock Objects
Unit testing relies on mock objects being created to test sections of code that are not yet part of a complete application. Mock objects fill in for the missing parts of the program.
For example, you might have a function that needs variables or objects that are not created yet. In unit testing, those will be accounted for in the form of mock objects created solely for the purpose of the unit testing done on that section of code.

Unit Testing Tools
There are several automated tools available to assist with unit testing. We will provide a few examples below:
Junit: Junit is a free to use testing tool used for Java programming language.  It provides assertions to identify test method. This tool test data first and then inserted in the piece of code.
NUnit:  NUnit is widely used unit-testing framework use for all .net languages.  It is an open source tool which allows writing scripts manually. It supports data-driven tests which can run in parallel.
JMockit:  JMockit is open source Unit testing tool.  It is a code coverage tool with line and path metrics. It allows mocking API with recording and verification syntax. This tool offers Line coverage, Path Coverage, and Data Coverage.
EMMA:  EMMA is an open-source toolkit for analyzing and reporting code written in Java language. Emma support coverage types like method, line, basic block. It is Java-based so it is without external library dependencies and can access the source code.
PHPUnit: PHPUnit is a unit testing tool for PHP programmer. It takes small portions of code which is called units and test each of them separately.  The tool also allows developers to use pre-define assertion methods to assert that a system behave in a certain manner. 
Those are just a few of the available unit testing tools. There are lots more, especially for C languages and Java, but you are sure to find a unit testing tool for your programming needs regardless of the language you use.

Test Driven Development (TDD) & Unit Testing
Unit testing in TDD involves an extensive use of testing frameworks. A unit test framework is used in order to create automated unit tests. Unit testing frameworks are not unique to TDD, but they are essential to it. Below we look at some of what TDD brings to the world of unit testing:

Tests are written before the code
Rely heavily on testing frameworks
All classes in the applications are tested
Quick and easy integration is made possible
Unit Testing Myth
Myth: It requires time, and I am always overscheduled
My code is rock solid! I do not need unit tests.
Myths by their very nature are false assumptions. These assumptions lead to a vicious cycle as follows -
Truth is Unit testing increase the speed of development.
Programmers think that Integration Testing will catch all errors and do not execute the unit test. Once units are integrated, very simple errors which could have very easily found and fixed in unit tested take a very long time to be traced and fixed.

Unit Testing Advantage
Developers looking to learn what functionality is provided by a unit and how to use it can look at the unit tests to gain a basic understanding of the unit API.
Unit testing allows the programmer to refactor code at a later date, and make sure the module still works correctly (i.e. Regression testing). The procedure is to write test cases for all functions and methods so that whenever a change causes a fault, it can be quickly identified and fixed.
Due to the modular nature of the unit testing, we can test parts of the project without waiting for others to be completed.
Unit Testing Disadvantages
Unit testing can't be expected to catch every error in a program. It is not possible to evaluate all execution paths even in the most trivial programs
Unit testing by its very nature focuses on a unit of code. Hence it can't catch integration errors or broad system level errors.
It's recommended unit testing be used in conjunction with other testing activities.

Unit Testing Best Practices
Unit Test cases should be independent. In case of any enhancements or change in requirements, unit test cases should not be affected.
Test only one code at a time.
Follow clear and consistent naming conventions for your unit tests
In case of a change in code in any module, ensure there is a corresponding unit Test Case for the module, and the module passes the tests before changing the implementation
Bugs identified during unit testing must be fixed before proceeding to the next phase in SDLC
Adopt a "test as your code" approach. The more code you write without testing, the more paths you have to check for errors.
Summary
UNIT TESTING is defined as a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested.
As you can see, there can be a lot involved in unit testing. It can be complex or rather simple depending on the application being tested and the testing strategies, tools and philosophies used. Unit testing is always necessary on some level. That is a certainty.

Web Application Firewall / WAF	 (GITHUB)  (test)

Web Application Firewall nedir
A WAF or Web Application Firewall helps protect web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between a web application and the Internet. It typically protects web applications from attacks such as cross-site forgery, cross-site-scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and SQL injection, among others. A WAF is a protocol layer 7 defense (in the OSI model), and is not designed to defend against all types of attacks. This method of attack mitigation is usually part of a suite of tools which together create a holistic defense against a range of attack vectors.
By deploying a WAF in front of a web application, a shield is placed between the web application and the Internet. While a proxy server protects a client machine’s identity by using an intermediary, a WAF is a type of reverse-proxy, protecting the server from exposure by having clients pass through the WAF before reaching the server.

A WAF operates through a set of rules often called policies. These policies aim to protect against vulnerabilities in the application by filtering out malicious traffic. The value of a WAF comes in part from the speed and ease with which policy modification can be implemented, allowing for faster response to varying attack vectors; during a DDoS attack, rate limiting can be quickly implemented by modifying WAF policies.

What is the difference between blocklist and allowlist WAFs?
A WAF that operates based on a blocklist (negative security model) protects against known attacks. Think of a blocklist WAF as a club bouncer instructed to deny admittance to guests who don’t meet the dress code. Conversely, a WAF based on an allowlist (positive security model) only admits traffic that has been pre-approved. This is like the bouncer at an exclusive party, he or she only admits people who are on the list. Both blocklists and allowlists have their advantages and drawbacks, which is why many WAFs offer a hybrid security model, which implements both.

What are network-based, host-based, and cloud-based WAFs?
A WAF can be implemented one of three different ways, each with it’s own benefits and shortcomings:
A network-based WAF is generally hardware-based. Since they are installed locally they minimize latency, but network-based WAFs are the most expensive option and also require the storage and maintenance of physical equipment.
A host-based WAF may be fully integrated into an application’s software. This solution is less expensive than a network-based WAF and offers more customizability. The downside of a host-based WAF is the consumption of local server resources, implementation complexity, and maintenance costs. These components typically require engineering time, and may be costly.
Cloud-based WAFs offer an affordable option that is very easy to implement; they usually offer a turnkey installation that is as simple as a change in DNS to redirect traffic. Cloud-based WAFs also have a minimal upfront cost, as users pay monthly or annually for security as a service. Cloud-based WAFs can also offer a solution that is consistently updated to protect against the newest threats without any additional work or cost on the user’s end. The drawback of a cloud-based WAF is that users hand over the responsibility to a third-party, therefore some features of the WAF may be a black box to them.

Penetration Test / Sızma Testi / Penetration Testing / Pen Test	 (GITHUB)  (test)

Penatration nedir, Penetration Test nedir / Penetration Testing nedir, pen test nedir
What is penetration testing
A penetration test, also known as a pen test, is a simulated cyber attack against your computer system to check for exploitable vulnerabilities. In the context of web application security, penetration testing is commonly used to augment a web application firewall (WAF).
-
Sızma testi , sistemin güvenliğini değerlendirmek üzere bir bilgisayar sistemi üzerinde gerçekleştirilen yetkilendirilmiş temsili bir siber saldırıdır. Test, yetkisiz kişilerin sistem özelliklerine ve verilerine[3][4] erişme potansiyelini içeren her iki zayıf noktayı (zafiyet olarak da bilinir) ve sistemin güçlü yönlerini belirlemek ve tam bir risk değerlendirmesi sağlamak için yapılır.
Süreç tipik olarak hedef sistemleri ve belirli bir hedefi tanımlar, daha sonra mevcut bilgileri gözden geçirir ve bu hedefe ulaşmak için çeşitli yollar arar. Bir sızma testi hedefi beyaz kutu (arka plan ve sistem bilgisi sağlar) veya kara kutu (sadece temel bilgi sağlar veya şirket adı dışında bilgi sağlamaz) olabilir. Gri kutu sızma testi ise ikisinin bir birleşimidir (hedef hakkındaki sınırlı bilgiyi denetçi ile paylaşır)[6].Sızma testi, bir sistemin savunmalarının yeterli olması durumunda saldırılara açık olup olmadığını veya saldırıların hangi savunmayı aştığını belirlemeye yardımcı olabilir.
-
Pen testing can involve the attempted breaching of any number of application systems, (e.g., application protocol interfaces (APIs), frontend/backend servers) to uncover vulnerabilities, such as unsanitized inputs that are susceptible to code injection attacks.
Insights provided by the penetration test can be used to fine-tune your WAF security policies and patch detected vulnerabilities.
Penetration testing stages
The pen testing process can be broken down into five stages.
1. Planning and reconnaissance
Defining the scope and goals of a test, including the systems to be addressed and the testing methods to be used.
Gathering intelligence (e.g., network and domain names, mail server) to better understand how a target works and its potential vulnerabilities.
2. Scanning
The next step is to understand how the target application will respond to various intrusion attempts. This is typically done using:
Static analysis – Inspecting an application’s code to estimate the way it behaves while running. These tools can scan the entirety of the code in a single pass.
Dynamic analysis – Inspecting an application’s code in a running state. This is a more practical way of scanning, as it provides a real-time view into an application’s performance.
3. Gaining Access
This stage uses web application attacks, such as cross-site scripting, SQL injection and backdoors, to uncover a target’s vulnerabilities. Testers then try and exploit these vulnerabilities, typically by escalating privileges, stealing data, intercepting traffic, etc., to understand the damage they can cause.
4. Maintaining access
The goal of this stage is to see if the vulnerability can be used to achieve a persistent presence in the exploited system— long enough for a bad actor to gain in-depth access. The idea is to imitate advanced persistent threats, which often remain in a system for months in order to steal an organization’s most sensitive data.
5. Analysis
The results of the penetration test are then compiled into a report detailing:
Specific vulnerabilities that were exploited
Sensitive data that was accessed
The amount of time the pen tester was able to remain in the system undetected
This information is analyzed by security personnel to help configure an enterprise’s WAF settings and other application security solutions to patch vulnerabilities and protect against future attacks.
Penetration testing methods
External testing
External penetration tests target the assets of a company that are visible on the internet, e.g., the web application itself, the company website, and email and domain name servers (DNS). The goal is to gain access and extract valuable data.
Internal testing
In an internal test, a tester with access to an application behind its firewall simulates an attack by a malicious insider. This isn’t necessarily simulating a rogue employee. A common starting scenario can be an employee whose credentials were stolen due to a phishing attack.
Blind testing
In a blind test, a tester is only given the name of the enterprise that’s being targeted. This gives security personnel a real-time look into how an actual application assault would take place.
Double-blind testing
In a double blind test, security personnel have no prior knowledge of the simulated attack. As in the real world, they won’t have any time to shore up their defenses before an attempted breach.
Targeted testing
In this scenario, both the tester and security personnel work together and keep each other appraised of their movements. This is a valuable training exercise that provides a security team with real-time feedback from a hacker’s point of view.
See how Imperva Web Application Firewall can help you with website security.
Penetration testing and WAFs are exclusive, yet mutually beneficial security measures.
For many kinds of pen testing (with the exception of blind and double blind tests), the tester is likely to use WAF data, such as logs, to locate and exploit an application’s weak spots.

In turn, WAF administrators can benefit from pen testing data. After a test is completed, WAF configurations can be updated to secure against the weak spots discovered in the test.
Finally, pen testing satisfies some of the compliance requirements for security auditing procedures, including PCI DSS and SOC 2. Certain standards, such as PCI-DSS 6.6, can be satisfied only through the use of a certified WAF. Doing so, however, doesn’t make pen testing any less useful due to its aforementioned benefits and ability to improve on WAF configurations.

Black-box Testing / Kara Kutu Testi	 (GITHUB)  (test)
Black-box Testing nedir black box testing nedir, black-box nedir, kara kutu testi nedir, kara kutu nedir
Black-box testing is a method of software testing that examines the functionality of an application without peering into its internal structures or workings. This method of test can be applied virtually to every level of software testing: unit, integration, system and acceptance. It is sometimes referred to as specification-based testing.

Test procedures
Specific knowledge of the application's code, internal structure and programming knowledge in general is not required.[2] The tester is aware of what the software is supposed to do but is not aware of how it does it. For instance, the tester is aware that a particular input returns a certain, invariable output but is not aware of how the software produces the output in the first place.[3]

Test cases
Test cases are built around specifications and requirements, i.e., what the application is supposed to do. Test cases are generally derived from external descriptions of the software, including specifications, requirements and design parameters. Although the tests used are primarily functional in nature, non-functional tests may also be used. The test designer selects both valid and invalid inputs and determines the correct output, often with the help of a test oracle or a previous result that is known to be good, without any knowledge of the test object's internal structure.

Software Regression	 (GITHUB)  (test)
Software regression nedir
A software regression is a software bug that makes a feature stop functioning as intended after a certain event (for example, a system upgrade, system patching or a change to daylight saving time). 
A software performance regression is a situation where the software still functions correctly, but performs more slowly or uses more memory or resources than before.
Regressions are often caused by encompassed bug fixes included in software patches. One approach to avoiding this kind of problem is regression testing. A properly designed test plan aims at preventing this possibility before releasing any software. Automated testing and well-written test cases can reduce the likelihood of a regression.
A software regression can be of one of three types:
Local – a change introduces a new bug in the changed module or component.
Remote – a change in one part of the software breaks functionality in another module or component.
Unmasked – a change unmasks an already existing bug that had no effect before the change.

Domain / Application Domain	 (GITHUB)  (test)
Domain nedir, application domain nedir
A domain is the targeted subject area of a computer program. It is a term used in software engineering. Formally it represents the target subject of a specific programming project, whether narrowly or broadly defined.[1] For example, a particular programming project might have had as a goal the creation of a program for a particular hospital, and that hospital would be the domain. Or the project could be expanded in scope to include all hospitals as their domain. In a computer programming design, you define a domain by delineating a set of common requirements, terminology, and functionality for any software program constructed to solve a problem in the area of computer programming, known as domain engineering. The word domain is also taken as a synonym of application domain.
Domain in the realm of software engineering commonly refers to the subject area on which the application is intended to apply. In other words, during application development, the domain is the "sphere of knowledge and activity around which the application logic revolves." —Andrew Powell-Morse
Domain: A sphere of knowledge, influence, or activity. The subject area to which the user applies a program is the domain of the software. —Eric Evans

Software quality assurance (SQA)	 (GITHUB)  (test)
Software quality assurance nedir, quality assurance nedir, qa nedir
Software quality assurance (SQA) is a process which assures that all software engineering processes, methods, activities and work items are monitored and comply against the defined standards. These defined standards could be one or a combination of any like ISO 9000, CMMI model, ISO15504, etc.

Software quality assurance (SQA) is a means and practice of monitoring the software engineering processes and methods used in a project to ensure proper quality of the software.[1]:10–5 It may include ensuring conformance to standards or models, such as ISO/IEC 9126 (now superseded by ISO 25010), SPICE or CMMI.
It includes standards and procedures that managers, administrators or even developers may use to review and audit software products and activities to verify that the software meets quality criteria which link to standards. According to Automotive SPICE (which is based on ISO/IEC 15504), software quality assurance is a supporting process (SUP.1) that provides the independent assurance that all work products, activities and processes comply with the predefined plans and quality strategies.
SQA encompasses the entire software development process, including requirements engineering, software design, coding, code reviews, source code control, software configuration management, testing, release management and software integration. It is organized into goals, commitments, abilities, activities, measurements, verification and validation.

Yazılım Kalite Güvencesi
Yazılım Kalite Güvencesi (SQA), kaliteli yazılım ürünleri ile sonuçlanan yazılım mühendisliği süreçlerinde kaliteyi sağlamak için yapılan faaliyetler dizisidir. Bu faaliyetler, ürünler üreten süreçleri belirler ve değerlendirir. Bu da süreç odaklı eylemi içerir.
Yazılım Kalite Kontrolü
Yazılım Kalite Kontrolü (SQC), yazılım ürünlerindeki kaliteyi sağlamak için kullanılan bir aktiviteler dizisidir. Bu faaliyetler üretilen gerçek ürünlerde kusurları tespit etmeye odaklanmaktadır. Ürün odaklı eylem içerir.
1.3. Peki, Neden Kalite Önemlidir?
Kaliteli ve güvenilir bir yazılım ürününün, istenilen gereksinim ve beklentileri belirlenen bütçeye göre zamanında teslim edilen bir ürün olduğunu söylüyoruz hep. Ayrıca, yazılım ürününün sürdürülebilir olmasının da önemli olduğu vurgulanıyor. Bu unsurların önemini yazılımda yapılan hataların örnekleri üzerinden görelim.
Yıl 1962, Mariner 1 roketi
Hatanın sonucu: Venüs’e giden Mariner 1 roketi, fırlatıldıktan hemen sonra rotasından saptı. Düşme riski çok yüksek olduğu için NASA mühendisleri kendi kendini imha etme emrini verdi. Roket havada 293 saniye sürdü. Kayıplar 18,5 milyon dolar olarak gerçekleşti.
Sebep: Programcı, el yazısıyla yazılmış formülü yanlış bir şekilde sembolün üstündeki satırı atlayarak bilgisayar koduna gömdü. Bu özellik kenar yumuşatmadan sorumlu olduğu için, yazılım belirli bir hızdan kritik olarak normal sapmaları algıladı. Sonuç olarak, roketteki bilgisayar yanlış düzenlemeler yaptı ve roketi rotasından saptırdı.
Yıl 1987, Hartford Coliseum salonunun çöküşü
Hatanın sonucu: İki basketbol takımının karşılaşmasının ardından birkaç saat geçmedi, çünkü stadyumun çelik çatısı ıslak kar ağırlığı altında çöktü. Kayıplar – 70 milyon dolar ve 20 milyona yakın yerel ekonomiye zarar.
Sebep: CAD programcısı, stadyumu tasarlamak için kullanılan yazılım ile çatı desteklerinin sadece küçüleceğini öne sürdü. Bu nedenle, bir tanesi karın ağırlığı altında çöktüğünde, zincir reaksiyonu başlattı ve çatı bir domino gibi art arda düştü.
1985, Tıbbi Therac-25 cihazı
Hatanın sonucu: Radyasyon tedavisi için Therac-25 tıbbi cihaz saptadı ve hastalara ölümcül dozda radyasyon verdi. Dört kişi öldü, iki kişinin sağlığına ise ciddi zarar verdi.
Sebep: Cihazın iki çalışma modu vardı – elektron ışını direkt olarak hastaya küçük dozlarda gönderildiğinde, ikincisi ise ışın ilk olarak radyasyon ışınlarına dönüşen ve hastaya iletilen metal bir “hedefe” yöneldiğinde. Cihazın önceki modellerinde, ikinci mod, yerinde “hedef” bulunan fiziksel dedektörlerle donatılmıştır, böylece ışınlar doğrudan hastaya büyük dozlarda yönlendirilmeyecekti. Therac-25’te, fiziksel dedektörler yazılım dedektörleri ile değiştirildi. Ne yazık ki, yazılım “aritmetik yüklenmeye” tabi tutuldu – sistem dahili hesaplarda kullanılmaya başlandı ve bu sayı onunla yapılan işlemler için çok büyük bir sayıydı. Bu esnada operatörün makineyi yapılandırması halinde güvenlik kontrolleri başarısız oldu ve “hedef” yerine oturmadı. Sonuç olarak, hasta 100 kat daha yüksek bir radyasyon dozu aldı.
1993, Pentium ve ondalık sayı hatası
Hata Sonucu: Intel’in yeni Pentium işlemcisi, belirli bir aralıktaki ondalıklı sayıları bölerken zaman zaman hata yaptı. Örneğin, 4195835.0 / 3145727.0 sonucu 1.33382 yerine 1.33374 sonucunu verdi. Bu da % 0.006’lık bir hata. Sorun az sayıda kullanıcıyı etkiledi, ancak Halkla İlişkiler hizmetlerinin kâbusu haline geldi. Kullanımda yaklaşık 5 milyon bozuk çip vardı. Intel başlangıçta, bu çipleri sadece yüksek hassasiyete ihtiyaç duyduğunu kanıtlayanlara değiştirmeyi teklif etti, ancak sonuç olarak tüm çipler değiştirildi. Kayıplar – 475 milyon dolara mâl oldu, bu da şirketin itibarına büyük hasara yol açtı.
Sebep: bölme tablosundaki bir hata, her bin göstergenin yaklaşık 5’inin eksik olmasıyla sonuçlandı ve yuvarlama hatasına neden oldu.
Yıl 1996, Ariane roketi
Hatanın sonucu: İnsansız füze Ariane fırlatıldıktan birkaç saniye sonra imha edildi. Roketle birlikte, dünyanın manyetik alanının güneş rüzgârıyla etkileşimini incelemek için kullanılan dört bilimsel uydu da imha edildi. Zararlar 500 milyon dolar (uydular) artı 8 milyar dolarlık Ariane geliştirme maliyetidir.
Sebep: Araç bilgisayarı roketin hızını 64 bit biçiminden 16 bit olana dönüştürmeyi denedi. Sonuç çok büyüktü ve bilgisayar başarısız oldu. Füzenin kontrolü, aynı algoritmayı kullanan güvenlik modülüne aktardı, ancak o da bir süre sonra kapandı.
Yıl 1998, Mars Climate Orbiter
Hatanın sonucu: uçuşunun 286. gününde, Mars Climate Orbiter uydusu, Mars eliptik yörüngesine geçiş başladı. Cihaz motorları fren yapmak için çevirdi ve yörüngeye “uçtu”. Büyük ihtimalle, Mars’ın atmosferine girdi ve çöktü. Kayıplar 125 milyon dolara ulaştı.
Sebep: motorun itiş gücünü kontrol eden yazılım, Newton’un ölçü birimi olarak pound kuvveti ölçü birimini kullanmıştır. Uydu rotasında bir sapmaya yol açan motor itme komutları ise ölçü birimi olarak Newton’ları kabul ediyordu.
Yıl 2008, Heathrow Havaalanı
Hatanın sonucu: Yeni Heathrow terminalinde çok sayıda ürünü taşımak için tasarlanmış ultra modern bir bagaj kontrol sistemi kurdular. Sistem 12 binden fazla çanta ve valizlerle kapsamlı bir şekilde test edilmiştir. Sonuç olarak, terminalin açılış gününde, sahipleriyle birlikte uçmadan 42 bin valiz kayboldu. 500’den fazla uçuş iptal edildi. Diğer uçuşlar için check-in geçici olarak askıya alındı.
Sebep: Sistem, bazı nedenlerle test sırasında test edilmeyen gerçek senaryolarla başa çıkamamıştır. Örneğin, valizlerin manuel olarak çıkarılması (yolcunun aniden valizde değerli ve gerekli bir şey olduğunu hatırlaması) programı çıldırtıyor ve kapatıyordu.

What is Software Quality Assurance?
Software quality assurance (SQA) is a process which assures that all software engineering processes, methods, activities and work items are monitored and comply against the defined standards. These defined standards could be one or a combination of any like ISO 9000, CMMI model, ISO15504, etc.
SQA incorporates all software development processes starting from defining requirements to coding until release. Its prime goal is to ensure quality.
Software Quality Assurance Plan
Abbreviated as SQAP, the software quality assurance plan comprises of the procedures, techniques, and tools that are employed to make sure that a product or service aligns with the requirements defined in the SRS(software requirement specification).
 
The plan identifies the SQA responsibilities of a team, lists the areas that need to be reviewed and audited. It also identifies the SQA work products.
The SQA plan document consists of the below sections:
Purpose section
Reference section
Software configuration management section
Problem reporting and corrective action section
Tools, technologies and methodologies section
Code control section
Records: Collection, maintenance and retention section
Testing methodology
SQA Activities
Given below is the list of SQA activities:
#1) Creating an SQA Management Plan:
The foremost activity includes laying down a proper plan regarding how the SQA will be carried out in your project.
Along with what SQA approach you are going to follow, what engineering activities will be carried out, and it also includes ensuring that you have a right talent mix in your team.

#2) Setting the Checkpoints:
The SQA team sets up different checkpoints according to which it evaluates the quality of the project activities at each checkpoint/project stage. This ensures regular quality inspection and working as per the schedule.
#3) Apply software Engineering Techniques:
Applying some software engineering techniques aids a software designer in achieving high-quality specification. For gathering information, a designer may use techniques such as interviews and FAST (Functional Analysis System Technique).
Later, based on the information gathered, the software designer can prepare the project estimation using techniques like WBS (work breakdown structure), SLOC (source line of codes), and FP(functional point) estimation.
#4) Executing Formal Technical Reviews:
An FTR is done to evaluate the quality and design of the prototype.
In this process, a meeting is conducted with the technical staff to discuss regarding the actual quality requirements of the software and the design quality of the prototype. This activity helps in detecting errors in the early phase of SDLC and reduces rework effort in the later phases.
#5) Having a Multi- Testing Strategy:
By multi-testing strategy, we mean that one should not rely on any single testing approach, instead, multiple types of testing should be performed so that the software product can be tested well from all angles to ensure better quality.
#6) Enforcing Process Adherence:
This activity insists the need for process adherence during the software development process. The development process should also stick to the defined procedures.
This activity is a blend of two sub-activities which are explained below in detail:
(i) Product Evaluation:
This activity confirms that the software product is meeting the requirements that were discovered in the project management plan. It ensures that the set standards for the project are followed correctly.
(ii) Process Monitoring:
This activity verifies if the correct steps were taken during software development. This is done by matching the actually taken steps against the documented steps.
#7) Controlling Change:
In this activity, we use a mix of manual procedures and automated tools to have a mechanism for change control.
By validating the change requests, evaluating the nature of change and controlling the change effect, it is ensured that the software quality is maintained during the development and maintenance phases.
#8) Measure Change Impact:
If any defect is reported by the QA team, then the concerned team fixes the defect.
After this, the QA team should determine the impact of the change which is brought by this defect fix. They need to test not only if the change has fixed the defect, but also if the change is compatible with the whole project.
For this purpose, we use software quality metrics which allows managers and developers to observe the activities and proposed changes from the beginning till the end of SDLC and initiate corrective action wherever required.
#9) Performing SQA Audits:
The SQA audit inspects the entire actual SDLC process followed by comparing it against the established process.
It also checks whatever reported by the team in the status reports were actually performed or not. This activity also exposes any non-compliance issues.
#10) Maintaining Records and Reports:
It is crucial to keep the necessary documentation related to SQA and share the required SQA information with the stakeholders. The test results, audit results, review reports, change requests documentation, etc. should be kept for future reference.
#11) Manage Good Relations:
In fact, it is very important to maintain harmony between the QA and the development team.
We often hear that testers and developers often feel superior to each other. This should be avoided as it can affect the overall project quality.
Software Quality Assurance Standards
In general, SQA may demand conformance to one or more standards.

Some of the most popular standards are discussed below:
ISO 9000: This standard is based on seven quality management principles which help the organizations to ensure that their products or services are aligned with the customer needs’.
7 principles of ISO 9000 are depicted in the below image:
 
CMMI level: CMMI stands for Capability maturity model Integration. This model was originated in software engineering. It can be employed to direct process improvement throughout a project, department, or an entire organization.
5 CMMI levels and their characteristics are described in the below image:
 
An organization is appraised and awarded a maturity level rating (1-5) based on the type of appraisal.
Test Maturity Model integration (TMMi): Based on CMMi, this model focuses on maturity levels in software quality management and testing.
5 TMMi levels are depicted in the below image:
 
As an organization moves on a higher maturity level, it achieves a higher capability for producing high-quality products with fewer defects and closely meets the business requirements.
Elements of Software Quality Assurance
There are 10 essential elements of SQA which are enlisted below for your reference:
Software engineering Standards
Technical reviews and audits
Software Testing for quality control
Error collection and analysis
Change management
Educational programs
Vendor management
Security management
Safety
Risk management
SQA Techniques
There are several techniques for SQA. Auditing is the chief technique that is widely adopted. However, we have a few other significant techniques as well.
Various SQA Techniques include:
Auditing: Auditing involves inspection of the work products and its related information to determine if the set of standard processes were followed or not.
Reviewing: A meeting in which the software product is examined by both the internal and external stakeholders to seek their comments and approval.
Code Inspection: It is the most formal kind of review that does static testing to find bugs and avoid defect growth in the later stages. It is done by a trained mediator/peer and is based on rules, checklist, entry and exit criteria. The reviewer should not be the author of the code.
Design Inspection: Design inspection is done using a checklist that inspects the below areas of software design:
General requirements and design
Functional and Interface specifications
Conventions
Requirement traceability
Structures and interfaces
Logic
Performance
Error handling and recovery
Testability, extensibility
Coupling and cohesion

Simulation: Simulation is a tool that models the real-life situation in order to virtually examine the behavior of the system under study.
Functional Testing: It is a QA technique which verifies what the system does without considering how it does. This type of black box testing mainly focuses on testing the system specifications or features.
Standardization: Standardization plays a crucial role in quality assurance. It decreases the ambiguity and guesswork, thus ensuring quality.
Static Analysis: It is a software analysis that is done by an automated tool without actually executing the program. This technique is highly used for quality assurance in medical, nuclear and aviation software. Software metrics and reverse engineering are some popular forms of static analysis.
Walkthroughs: Software walkthrough or code walkthrough is a kind of peer review where the developer guides the members of the development team to go through the product and raise queries, suggest alternatives, make comments regarding possible errors, standard violations or any other issues.
Path Testing: It is a white box testing technique where the complete branch coverage is ensured by executing each independent path at least once.
Stress Testing: This type of testing is done to check how robust a system is by testing it under heavy load i.e. beyond normal conditions.
Six Sigma: Six Sigma is a quality assurance approach that aims at nearly perfect products or services. It is widely applied in many fields including software. The main objective of six sigma is process improvement so that the produced software is 99.76 % defect free.
Conclusion
SQA is an umbrella activity which is employed throughout the software lifecycle.
Software quality assurance is very important for your software product or service to succeed in the market and survive up to the customer’s expectations.
There are various activities, standards, and techniques that you need to follow to assure that the deliverable software is of high quality and aligns closely with the business needs.

HTTP 	(GITHUB)  (test)
http nedir
 HTTP (İngilizce Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol, Türkçe Hiper-Metin Transfer Protokolü) bir kaynaktan dağıtılan ve ortak kullanıma açık olan hiperortam bilgi sistemleri için uygulama seviyesinde bir iletişim protokolüdür.
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.[1] HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.
Development of HTTP was initiated by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989. Development of early HTTP Requests for Comments (RFCs) was a coordinated effort by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), with work later moving to the IETF.
HTTP/1.1 was first documented in RFC 2068 in 1997. That specification was obsoleted by RFC 2616 in 1999, which was likewise replaced by the RFC 7230 family of RFCs in 2014.
HTTP/2 is a more efficient expression of HTTP's semantics "on the wire", and was published in 2015; it is now supported by virtually all web browsers[2] and major web servers over Transport Layer Security (TLS) using an Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) extension[3] where TLS 1.2 or newer is required.[4][5]
HTTP/3 is the proposed successor to HTTP/2,[6][7] which is already in use on the web (enabled by default in latest macOS), using UDP instead of TCP for the underlying transport protocol. Like HTTP/2, it does not obsolete previous major versions of the protocol. Support for HTTP/3 was added to Cloudflare and Google Chrome in September 2019,[8][9] and can be enabled in the stable versions of Chrome and Firefox.[10]

HTTPS 	(GITHUB)  (test)
 https nedir, http nedir

Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It is used for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet.[1][2] In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or, formerly, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The protocol is therefore also referred to as HTTP over TLS,[3] or HTTP over SSL.
The principal motivations for HTTPS are authentication of the accessed website, and protection of the privacy and integrity of the exchanged data while in transit. It protects against man-in-the-middle attacks, and the bidirectional encryption of communications between a client and server protects the communications against eavesdropping and tampering.[4][5] In practice, this provides a reasonable assurance that one is communicating with the intended website without interference from attackers.
The authentication aspect of HTTPS requires a trusted third party to sign server-side digital certificates. This was historically an expensive operation, which meant fully authenticated HTTPS connections were usually found only on secured payment transaction services and other secured corporate information systems on the World Wide Web. In 2016, a campaign by the Electronic Frontier Foundation with the support of web browser developers led to the protocol becoming more prevalent.[6] HTTPS is now used more often by web users than the original non-secure HTTP, primarily to protect page authenticity on all types of websites; secure accounts; and to keep user communications, identity, and web browsing private.[7]
The team here at KeyCDN is always encouraging people to make the move to HTTPS for a number of reasons such as performance benefits, additional security, and even SEO advantages. We are constantly throwing around the HTTP and HTTPS acronyms and sometimes its important to understand the basics of how they work and some history behind them. So today we thought we would explore more in-depth the difference between HTTP and HTTPS, what they mean, and why it might be time for you to make the move to HTTPS.
HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. When you enter http:// in your address bar in front of the domain, it tells the browser to connect over HTTP. HTTP uses TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), generally over port 80, to send and receive data packets over the web. To put it simply it is a protocol that's used by a client and server which allows you to communicate with other websites. The client sends a request message to an HTTP server (after the TCP handshake) which hosts a website, the server then replies with the response message. The response message contains completion status information, such as HTTP/1.1 200 OK.
TCP has had enhancements over the years but for the most part is very much the same as it was when it first defined in 1974, RFC 675. HTTP also uses UDP (User Datagram Protocol), designed by David Reed in 1980, defined in RFC 768. It is less reliable but widely used in video conferencing, video games, and streaming. It allows individual packets to be dropped and received in a different order for better performance.
The term hypertext originally came from Ted Nelson in 1965. The original HTTP was developed and originally proposed by Tim Berners-Lee, the director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The W3C's mission is to lead the web to its full potential by developing protocols and guidelines that ensure the long-term growth of the web.
There was a time when people felt the internet was another world, but now people realize it's a tool that we use in this world.
- Tim Berners-Lee
The first documentation of HTTP was published in 1991 as HTTP/0.9 which only consisted of one HTTP request method, GET (requests data from a specified resource). In 1996 HTTP 1.0, RFC 1945, was developed and this consisted of three HTTP request methods, GET, HEAD, and POST (submits data to be processed to a specified resource). Finally in 1997, the HTTP/1.1 protocol, RFC 2068, was developed as a revision of HTTP 1.0 and after 19 years it is still used today for all HTTP requests.
Over the years there are have been some slight revisions to HTTP/1.1. In 1999, RFC 2616 introduced five new methods, OPTIONS, PUT, TRACE, CONNECT, and DELETE. And then in March 2010, RFC 5789 introduced the PATCH method. As of today the current version defines nine different request methods.
In HTTP/0.9 and 1.0 the connection was closed after a single request. In HTTP/1.1 persisted connections (more than one request/response on the same HTTP connection) were introduced, which dramatically reduced latency. Other improvements such as caching, better compression support, and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) were also added.
If there is a problem with an HTTP request there is a list of status codes which inform your browser so that you can better troubleshoot what the problem might be. The way the user-agent handles the response depends upon the code and the response header fields. For example, a 404 Not Found error means the the content either does not exist or has been moved. Or another common example is a 502 Bad Gateway error which could mean that the domain name is not resolving to the correct IP or it does not resolve to any IP.
What is HTTPS?#
HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (also referred to as HTTP over TLS or HTTP over SSL). When you enter https:// in your address bar in front of the domain, it tells the browser to connect over HTTPS. Generally sites running over HTTPS will have a redirect in place so even if you type in http:// it will redirect to deliver over a secured connection. HTTPS also uses TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) to send and receive data packets, but it does so over port 443, within a connection encrypted by Transport Layer Security (TLS).
 
As of April 2016, 41.7% of the Internet's 141,160 most popular websites have a secure implementation of HTTPS.
- SSL Pulse
Remember Nestcape? Well HTTPS was actually created by Netscape Communications back in 1994 to use in its Netscape Navigator web browser. HTTPS originally used the SSL protocol which eventually evolved into TLS, the current version defined in RFC 2818 in May 2000. That is why you might hear the terms SSl and TLS thrown around quite loosely.
HTTPS transmits its data security using an encrypted connection. Basically it uses a public key which is then decrypted on the recipient side. The public key is deployed on the server, and included in what you know as an SSL certificate. The certificates are cryptographically signed by a Certificate Authority (CA), and each browser has a list of CAs it implicitly trusts. Any certificate signed by a CA in the trusted list is given a green padlock lock in the browser's address bar, because it's proven to be "trusted" and belongs to that domain. Companies like Let's Encrypt have now made the process of issuing SSL certificates free.
We wrote a post a while back on why you should be establishing SSL trust for your business. According to a GlobalSign survey, 84% of shoppers abandon a purchase if data was sent over an unsecured connection and 28.9% look for the green address bar. Never enter your credit card details on websites that run over HTTP. The main purpose of using HTTPS is for security and privacy reasons. When the data is encrypted this means nothing is passing in plain text. A lot of people might question whether they need to bother with HTTPS on smaller sites, like a blog, but remember even your login page should be encrypted.
SPDY#
SPDY (pronounced SPeeDY) is a network protocol that was designed by Google with the aim to make the web faster. It was originally announced back in 2009. SPDY requires the use of SSL/TLS (with TLS extension ALPN) for security but it also supports operation over plain TCP.
The three main benefits were:
1.	Allows client and server to compress request and response headers, which reduces bandwidth usage when the similar headers (e.g. X-Cache) are sent over and over again for multiple requests.
2.	Allows multiple requests over a single connection and therefore saving on round trips between client and server. Further, preventing low priority assets from delaying higher priority requests.
3.	Enables the server to proactively push assets to the client that it knows the client will require (e.g. CSS and images) without waiting for the client to request them.

Check out the difference between HTTP/1.1 and SPDY 3.1. However, on February 11, 2016, Google announced that Chrome will no longer support SPDY in favor of HTTP/2.
HTTP/2#
HTTP/2 is the protocol update to HTTP/1.1 and is based on SPDY. It was developed by the IETF's HTTP Working Group, published in May 2015 and defined in RFC 7540. Because of browser support for HTTP/2, HTTPS is currently required to take advantage of it. Read about the difference between SPDY3.1 and HTTP/2.
As of April 2016 7.3% of the top 10 million websites support HTTP/2.
- W3Techs
Here are some of the benefits of HTTP/2:
•	HTTP/2 is binary, instead of textual.
•	It is fully multiplexed, instead of ordered and blocking.
•	Speed increase reduces additional round trip times (RTT), making your website load faster without any optimization.
•	It can use one connection for parallelism.
•	It uses HPACK compression with Huffman encoding to reduce headers.
•	It allows servers to "push" responses proactively into client caches instead of waiting for a new request for each resource.
•	The new ALPN extension allows faster-encrypted connections since the application protocol is determined during the initial connection.
•	Domain sharding and asset concatenation is no longer needed with HTTP/2.
•	Addresses the head of line blocking problem in HTTP/1.1.
More and more bigger brands and sites are now making the move to HTTP/2, such as Wikipedia this week. You can use KeyCDN's HTTP/2 test tool to check if your current server or CDN provider support HTTP/2.
As of this morning, https://t.co/Bv0erJiH66 supports HTTP/2. Tested by https://t.co/mykDE06rEv #http2 #webperf
- Wikipedia (@Wikipedia) May 4, 2016
KeyCDN has supported HTTP/2 across all of its edge servers for customers since October 2015.
What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?#
Below are some of the main differences between the HTTP and HTTPS protocols, in no particular order.
1.	HTTP URL in your browser's address bar is http:// and the HTTPS URL is https://.
2.	HTTP is unsecured while HTTPS is secured.
3.	HTTP sends data over port 80 while HTTPS uses port 443.
4.	HTTP operates at application layer, while HTTPS operates at transport layer.
5.	No SSL certificates are required for HTTP, with HTTPS it is required that you have an SSL certificate and it is signed by a CA.
6.	HTTP doesn't require domain validation, where as HTTPS requires at least domain validation and certain certificates even require legal document validation.
7.	No encryption in HTTP, with HTTPS the data is encrypted before sending.
Summary#
We highly encourage you to think about switching over to HTTPS. The TLS negotiation and CPU overhead are now very negligible and in a lot of tests we have seen performance improvements when people make the switch from HTTP to HTTPS, as long as they are running over HTTP/2. Make sure to also check out our HTTP to HTTPS migration guide. And don't forget, you can deploy KeyCDN assets over HTTPS, even if you haven't had time to migrate your origin server yet.

Domain-driven Design / DDD 	(GITHUB)  (test)
 Domain-driven design nedir, domain driven design nedir

DDD’ın temel amacı; hızlı değişen gereksinimlere hızlı adaptasyon sağlayan, kolay ölçeklenebilir, esnek ve highly available yazılımlar üretmektir. DDD’da uygulamanın içerisinde yer alan business kurallar, mantıksal olarak domain’lere dağıtılır. Sorumluluk olarak birbiri ile en alakalı birimler aynı domain üzerinde tutulurken, diğer birimler ise farklı domain’lere taşınır. Bu yaklaşımın dayandığı temel prensipler vardır. Temel diyorum çünkü tümü değil.
DDD, herkes tarafından anlaşılması kolay modeller oluşturmayı hedeflemektedir. Bu modelleri domain expert’leri ve developer için görünür kılmak ve somutlaştırmak adına herkesin anlayabileceği bir gösterim yöntemi seçilmelidir. Örnek olarak UML veya pseudo code bile olabilir.
Ubiquitous Language
Martin Fowler bu kavramı, yazılım ekibi ile domain expert’leri arasında ortak ve açık bir dilin kurulması olarak açıklamaktadır. Ortak dilin açık olması sayesinde gereksinimler üzerindeki belirsizlikler giderilmiş olacaktır.
Eric Evans’a göre ortak bir dil belirlemek test süreçlerini kolaylaştıracağı gibi gereksinimlerin değişmesi durumunda yazılım takımının bu değişiklikleri kolay anlayabilmesini sağlayacaktır.
Domain expertleri, domainin anlaşmasını zorlaştıracak kullanışsız veya yetersiz olan terimlere veya yapılara itiraz etmelidir. Developerlar tasarımı zor duruma düşürebilecek belirsizlikleri veya tutarsızlıkları kabul etmemelidirler. Ortak dil oluştururken aşağıdaki maddelere dikkat edilmelidir:

 
Possible bounded contexts for an online store
TL;DR;
Domain-driven design [DDD] is the practice of architecting your project according to the domains it touches, following some rules discussed in the book where Eric Evans first described it.
Most likely nobody but Evans understands DDD, due to its complexity, so I wouldn’t recommend it to simple apps.
I know that I don’t do it 100% but the little I understand helps me already to break complex apps into small simpler parts. Of course, I’ll focus on what I know here.

DDD 
The bigger the project, the harder it is to maintain it. A way to help with that is breaking the app into smaller areas according to their business rules, known as domains.
Basically, a domain is an area of knowledge, either public, like the rules of chess, or private, like the business rules of a nonprofit organization [NPO].
A complex domain is likely to use knowledge from other domains. For instance, an NPO which teaches chess online will know about chess, teaching through online platforms, and, even though you are not charged as a student, about its finances.
Each subdomain of your domain is known in DDD as bounded contexts, each has its own model of the world built with specialized units of code, known as building blocks. Here I’ll focus on entities and value-objects, both can be referenced as objects.
Entities are objects meant to be unique within the domain. This is achieved by using one or more proprieties to identify a given entity. For instance, two users using the same name in a system will always have different emails because emails cannot be repeated — more often than not, entities are differentiated by an id, and sometimes by a combination of proprieties.
Value-objects, on the other hand, don't have an identity, so only their properties can be used to distinguish between two instances. Take for example two pawns (the chess token), they look the same if they come from the same game set and have the same color, so it doesn't matter if you swap them around. In DDD, value-objects are immutable so it is easier to reason with them.
Data integrity
A bounded context does not expose all of its objects to guarantee its data integrity. Instead, it exposes some aggregate roots as a kind of public interface to itself.
An aggregate is nothing more than an entity that is composed of other objects. To be more precise, an aggregate is a cluster of associated objects that we treat as a unit when changing data.

 
An aggregate and its root
In practical terms, aggregates will assume the shape of the data structure known as a tree. And for that reason, all aggregates have a root.
The only member of an aggregate that other objects can refer to is its root, and thus this is what we expose. This is done like this because it prevents other objects to tweak data in a way the aggregate cannot control.
Important to make clear that a bounded context might use many aggregates even when their root are not directly exposed to the outside world.
Dealing with multiple bounded contexts
But things can get more complicated, right? Each bounded context gets a slightly different model of the same objects, having different proprieties and behaviors. So a user in a game context may have a property to handle its score which in a financial context is irrelevant and thus does not exist.
And that’s not all. It is also possible that a domain concept, represented as an entity in a bounded context, to be represented as an object-value in another, or just to be completely omitted.
For example, while the teaching context requires teachers to be represented as entities so they can be assigned to students by their ids, the finance context prefers to see "teacher" as a value for the position property of the employee entity.
Some of other DDD building blocks are services, repositories, factories and events. I'll try to describe them briefly.
Services are capabilities of a domain that don’t naturally fit entities nor object-values. Beware that they are domain services, not application or infrastructure services.
Repositories are bridges to storage units — hello CRUD!.
Factories are methods for creating domain objects so they never have invalid values. This part is what got me started on thinking about product-driven tests.
Events are objects that represent something that happened in the domain — its experts care about them. Great opportunities for create an event-driven application .

Though I don't remember Evans stating so, bounded contexts are a nice opportunity to split your code up into microservices, where each service is a context on its own. The first step might be a "virtual" break up where each context is put into a different module on the same app, and then if you detect that they are really isolated, move them to different ones. 

A language to rule them all
One of the first things people learn when studying DDD is that their system should be described by a ubiquitous language. That is, we should write code using the same verbs (for methods or services) and nouns (for objects) that the domain experts use when talking to us.
Writing code like this has the advantage of closing the communication gap between developers and experts when they are talking but it's an oversimplification of real-life, so I personally use it as a guideline but not a final solution.
I saved it to the last because, for me, the most important thing about DDD is usually not read, as it is in the "complex" part of the book.
Recently I’ve learned that the author himself said the order he presents things in the book is not optimal, and what I described here is closer to what would have been ideal 😍. I heard it on a podcast refering to this one

Domain: Yazılım dünyasında domain; bir uygulama içerisinde bir biri ile bağlantılı olan ve uygulamanın logic’ini oluşturan ufak kümeler anlamına gelmektedir.
“Domain Driven Design(DDD), kompleks gereksinimlerin var olduğu bir dünyada, sürekli değişen temel business kurallarını birbirine derinlemesine bağlayan bir yazılım geliştirme yaklaşımıdır. “
DDD ilk olarak Eric Evans tarafından ortaya atılmış ve bir çok konuda olduğu gibi Martin Fowler’dan da destek görmüş bir yaklaşımdır. Eric Evans büyük ve karmaşık sistemlerdeki sorunların domainlere bölünerek, kendi domaini içerisinde çözülmesi gerektiğini savunmaktadır. Bu problemlerin çoğunun business taraf ile teknik tarafın ortak bir dil konuşamamasından ve yazılımın doğru modellenmemesinden kaynaklı olduğunu düşünmektedir.
DDD’ın temel amacı; hızlı değişen gereksinimlere hızlı adaptasyon sağlayan, kolay ölçeklenebilir, esnek ve highly available yazılımlar üretmektir. DDD’da uygulamanın içerisinde yer alan business kurallar, mantıksal olarak domain’lere dağıtılır. Sorumluluk olarak birbiri ile en alakalı birimler aynı domain üzerinde tutulurken, diğer birimler ise farklı domain’lere taşınır. Bu yaklaşımın dayandığı temel prensipler vardır. Temel diyorum çünkü tümü değil.
Representing the Model
DDD, herkes tarafından anlaşılması kolay modeller oluşturmayı hedeflemektedir. Bu modelleri domain expert’leri ve developer için görünür kılmak ve somutlaştırmak adına herkesin anlayabileceği bir gösterim yöntemi seçilmelidir. Örnek olarak UML veya pseudo code bile olabilir.
Ubiquitous Language
Martin Fowler bu kavramı, yazılım ekibi ile domain expert’leri arasında ortak ve açık bir dilin kurulması olarak açıklamaktadır. Ortak dilin açık olması sayesinde gereksinimler üzerindeki belirsizlikler giderilmiş olacaktır.
Eric Evans’a göre ortak bir dil belirlemek test süreçlerini kolaylaştıracağı gibi gereksinimlerin değişmesi durumunda yazılım takımının bu değişiklikleri kolay anlayabilmesini sağlayacaktır.
Domain expertleri, domainin anlaşmasını zorlaştıracak kullanışsız veya yetersiz olan terimlere veya yapılara itiraz etmelidir. Developerlar tasarımı zor duruma düşürebilecek belirsizlikleri veya tutarsızlıkları kabul etmemelidirler. Ortak dil oluştururken aşağıdaki maddelere dikkat edilmelidir:
Ortak dil bir fikrin uygulamasından ziyade amacını anlatmalıdır
Ortak bir dilin konuşulması hem domain expert’leri hem de geliştiriciler açısından değerli ve yaratıcı olacaktır.
Ortak dil içerisinde Domain expertlerinin gözünden kaçabileceği veya varsayımda bulunabileceği ciddi boyutta teknik veya business engeller olabilir. Örneğin, bir domain experti “Eğer bir yolcu uçuş için kayıt yaptırmışsa ve uçak dolu ise status’u waiting olarak güncellenir. Uçak müsait olduğunda kişiye message bus üzerinden ödeme işlemi için mail gönderilir ve payment gateway üzerinden ödeme alınır.” cümlesini kurduğunu düşünelim. Burada domain expertin daha önceden farklı bir uygulamayı referans aldığını “statusu waiting olarak güncellenir” cümlesinden anlayabiliriz. Diğer cümlesinde ise ödeme işleminde ne olacağına dair bir bilgi vermemiş. Son olarak payment gateway üzerinden ödeme alınır kısmı ise amaçtan ziyade yine uygulamaya odaklanıldığını göstermektedir. Bu tarz söylemler varsayımlar içerdiği için kaçınılmalıdır.
2. Ayrıntılara odaklanılmalı
Ana kavramı ve kavramın amacını öğrenmek için daha derin detaylara inilmelidir. Örneğin önceki konuşmayı tekrar hatırlayalım; “Eğer bir yolcu bir uçuş için kayıt yaptırmışsa ve uçak dolu ise status’u waiting olarak güncellenir. Uçak müsait olduğunda kişiye message bus üzerinden ödeme işlemi için mail gönderilir ve payment gateway üzerinden ödeme alınır.” idi. Buradan şu detayları yakalayabiliriz; uçuş için rezervasyon yaptırabilmiş kişinin bir durumu yoktur, bir yolcunun her uçuş için rezervasyon yaptırması bir kayıta karşılık gelir, eğer uçak dolu ise kullanıcının rezervasyonu standby’a alınır ve bekleme listesi üzerinden yönetilir.
3. Ortak Dil Sürekli İyileştirilmeli
Ortak dil domain modeli oluşturmak ve görünür kılmak için kullanılır. Domain model güncellendiğinde veya yeni terminolojiler geldiğinde ortak dil de güncellenmelidir. Burada dikkat edilmesi gereken husus yeni eklenen terimlerin, domain expertler tarafından kabul görmesi ve amacına uygun kullanılması olacaktır. Örneğimize bir kaç yeni terim eklediğimizde güncel hali “Bir yolcu bir uçuş için rezervasyon yaptığında bir rezervasyon kaydı verilir. Eğer uygun koltuk var ise ödeme alınır ve rezervasyon onaylanır. Eğer uygun koltuk yok ise kayıtlı rezervasyon standby rezervasyon olarak bekleme listesine atılır. “ gibi olacaktır.
4. Somut Örnekler ile Çalışılmalı
Domain expertleri ile birlikte Domain modele katkı sağlamanın en kolay yolu çoğunlukla somut örneklerle çalışmaktır. Çoğu zaman, Behavior-Driven Development kullanılarak scenario ve story şablonları üzerinden domain örneklerini oluşturulur. Örnek olarak önceki kullandığımız örneğe bir scenario ve story yazalım:
Story : Uçuşa rezervasyon yaptırmaBir yolcu olarak bir uçuş ararımBir uçuşa rezervasyon yaptırmak isterimBöylece gitmek istediğim yere kısa sürede gidebilirim
Bu story’de rol, ne yapmak istediği ve ne kazanımlar elde edeceği bellidir. Story birden fazla senaryo içerebilir. Ancak biz önceki örneklerde uçağın dolu olması senaryosu üzerinde durduğumuz için aşağıda da o senaryoyu yazalım.
Scenario: Uçak doluVerilen bilgilere göre SAW-123 uçuşu için uçakta 100 koltuk ayrılmışAncak mevcut durumda 100 yolcu da rezervasyonlarını onaylamışSAW-123 uçuşu için rezevasyon yapmak istediğimdeBenim rezervasyonumu Standby rezervasyon olarak güncellenmeliRezervasyonum bekleme listesi içerisinde yönetilmeli
‘Verilen’ kelimesi, senaryo için koşulları açıklar. ‘istediğimde’ kelimesi, senaryoda gerçekleşen aksiyondur sonrasındaki iki madde, olay gerçekleştikten sonra beklenen sonucu açıklar.
Strategic Design
Strategic design, büyük modellerin ve bu modellerin içerisindeki bütün parçaların tasarlanmasına ve birbiri ile ilişkilerinin tanımlanmasına odaklanır. Bu sayede içerisinde ufak, kendi içerisinde yönetilmesi kolay modeller bulunan büyük bir tasarım elde etmiş oluruz. Bu ufak modeller alakalı olan context’ler içerisinde toplanır. Modellerin hangi context’ler içerisinde yer aldığı herkes tarafından kolayca anlaşılabilir olmalıdır.

Bounded Context
Bounded Context, DDD’ın strateji tasarım kısmına odaklanmış en merkezi prensiptir. Bütün modeller sınırları belli olan bağımsız context’ler içerisinde tanımlanmalıdır. Context’ler oluşturulurken, takımın nasıl organize edildiğine, Code Base’in yer aldığı projenin yapısına ve düzenine, context’in domain içerisinde kullanılacağı kısıma dikkat edilmelidir. Context’ler kendi içerisinde tutarlı ve bir bütün olmalıdır. Context’ler dışarı çıkartıldığında davranışı değiştirilmeye çalışılmamalıdır. Diğer context’ler farklı modeller ve kavramlar içerebilir, genel bir context yapısı olmak zorunda değildir. Her domain’in kendine özgü ortak bir dil lehçesi olabilir (DSL — Domain Specific Language).
 
Context Mapping
Context mapping, bounded context’lerin temas noktalarını ve aradaki haberleşmeyi açık bir şekilde map eden bir tasarım sürecidir. Mapping sürecinde uygulanabilecek bir çok kalıp vardır. Bunlardan bazılarını kısaca aşağıda özetleyelim.
Shared Kernel
Farklı takımlar tarafından paylaşılan domain’in alt kümelerini içeren bounded context’lerdir. Takımlar arasında iyi bir iletişim ve işbirliği olmalıdır. Shared Kernel kullanmadan iki kere düşünmek gerekir. Yeterince olgunlaşmamış ekipler için verimsiz olabilir.

 
2. Customer/Supplier Development Teams
Bir bounded context diğer bounded context’i beslerse veya bir hizmet sağlarsa alttaki bounded context üsttekine bağımlı hale gelir.Bu durumda üstteki bounded context supplier rolünü alırken alttaki ise customer rolünü almış olur. Bu kalıpta takımların kabul testlerini birlikte yapmaları gerekmektedir. Böylece birlikte çalışabilirlik (compatibility) açısından çıkacak hatalar minimize edilmiş olur.
3. Conformist
Alt bounded context’te çalışan ekibin, üst bounded context’te çalışan ekiple işbirliği yapma konusunda söz sahibi değilse veya fırsatı yoksa yukarıdaki bounded context’e uymak için çok az seçenek vardır. Alt bounded context’te dikte edilen arayüzlerin pek çok nedeni olabilir, ancak bu durum birlikte çalışabilirlik açısından yaşanabilecek bir çok problemi ortadan kaldırır. Bu durumda alt context’in kalitesi doğrudan üst context’in kalitesine bağlı hale gelir.
 
4. Anti-corruption Layer
Farklı sistemlerdeki bounded contexts’ler ile ilişki kurulmaya çalışıldığında modellerin uyumsuzluğundan kaynaklı bir takım sorunlar meydana gelebilir. Bu durumda iki bounded context’i birbirinden mümkün olduğu kadar soyutlamak ve her iki taraf için de conversion yapan bir katman oluşturmak en doğrusu olacaktır. Bu conversion sonucu her client kendi modeli ile çalışabilir durumda olacaktır. Anti-corruption layer kalıbı özellikle legacy sistemlerin bulunduğu yapılarda oldukça yararlı olacaktır.
 
5. Seperate Ways
Bu kalıpta context’ler arasındaki ilişki detaylı olarak incelenir. Eğer zorunluluktan doğan fonksiyonel bir ilişki bulunmuyorsa bu iki context ayrıştırılır. Bu sayede entegrasyon maliyetinden kazanım elde etmiş oluruz.
 
Bu model, developerların (ve hatta yöneticilerinin) çok sınırlı bir alanda odaklı çözümler bulmasına olanak tanıdığı karmaşıklığı önemli derecede ortadan kaldırır.
Modelling the Domain
Strategic Design başlığı altında eforumuzu, bounded context’ler içerisinde anlaşılması kolay, kendini ifade edebilen modellerin oluşturulması için harcamamız gerektiğini ve implementasyonun ikinci planda bırakılması gerektiğini ifade etmiştik. Bunu başarabildiysek modelleri refactor etmek oldukça basit olacaktır.
Domain modellemede kullanılan bir çok kalıp vardır. Aşağıda en çok kullanılan kalıpları bulabilirsiniz.
Dealing with Structure
Entities: Programlama dünyasından bildiğimiz entityler’dir. Her entity’nin bir identity’si vardır ve asla değişmez. Entity’lerin diğer propertyleri değişebilir.
Value Objects: Yine programlana dünyasından bildiğimiz DTO’lardır. Value Object’ler’in identity’si yoktur. Sadece data transferinde kullanılan dummy objelerden ziyade içerisinde bazı business’lar bulundurabilir. Entity’leri bu tarz hesaplamalardan ve business logic’lerden arındırmak için kullanılırlar. Bu sayede entity’ler kendi yapması gereken işlere odaklanır. Ancak işin kötü yanı value object’ler içerisinde bir miktar functional programming yapılabilmektedir.
Cardinality of Associations: Bir entity’nin diğer entity’ler ile doğrudan ilişkili olduğu duruma cardinality denir. Cardinality of Associations, bir tarafta var olan entitiy’nin diğer tarafta kaç adet entity ile etkileşim içerisinde olduğunu açıklar. Bu durum yapının karmaşıklığını arttırmaktadır. Domain içerisinde gerçekten böyle bir şeye ihtiyaç olup olmadığı sorgulanmalıdır.
Services: Bazı durumlarda tek bir class içerisinde bütün entity ve DTO’lara ait logic’leri barındıramayabiliriz. Bu durum single reponsibility açısında da oldukça yanlış olacaktır. O nedenle birden fazla stateless sınıf içerisine bu logic’leri dağıtarak birbirinden soyutlarız. Bu yapılara servis adı verilir.
Aggregates: Yeni modeller ekledikçe mevcut obje grafiğimiz daha büyük ve kompleks olacaktır. Bu büyük grafikler üzerinde teknik implementasyonlar yapmak, transaction’ları sınırlamak, eş zamanlı hale getirmek ve dağıtmak oldukça zorlaşacaktır. Aggregate’ler kendi sınırları içerisindeki objeleri grafiğin geri kalanından kopararak belirli bir alan içerisinde tutar. Her aggregate’in içerisinde ana görevi üstlenmiş bir entity bulunmaktadır. Yeni bir aggregate yaratıldığında domain içerisinde kendi başına ayrı bir parça olarak anlamlı olduğuna emin olunmalıdır. Aggregate’in doğruluğunu test etmek için silme testi uygulanabilir. Bu test sayesinde ana obje silindiğinde aggregate’in içerisinde veya dışında hangi objelerin de silinmesi gerektiği tespit edilebilir.
Aggregate’ler domain’i daha sade bir hale getirerek teknik engellerin ortadan kaldırılmasına yardımcı olur. Bunu sağlayabilmek için aggregate’ler kendi içerisinde tutarsız olsa bile tüm aggregate’ler birbirleri ile tutarlı olmalıdırlar.
2. Dealing with Life Cycles
Factories: Aggregate’lerin yaşam döngüsünün başlangıcını yönetirler. Aslında bildiğimiz factory design pattern’in veya builder design pattern’in uygulanmasıdır. Aggregate içerisinde kurallar işletildikten sonra uygun bir obje yaratılmalıdır. Factory design pattern kullanışlık olsa da kullanmak şart değildir.
Repositories: Aggregate’lerin yaşam döngüsünün orta ve bitiş kısmını yönetirler. Repository’ler ilişkisel veritabanlarının görevlerini temsil eden yapılardır. Repository’lerin de aggregate’ler ile çalışabildiğini de göz önünde bulundurursak, repository’ler üzerinden alınan objeler için de aggregate kurallarının uygulanması gerektiğini söyleyebiliriz(aggregation içerisinde ilişkilere uygun objelerin mapping’i vs.).
3. Dealing with Behavior
Specification Pattern: Bir nesne içerisindeki dönüş tipi boolean olan bir business kuralı, validation veya selection criteria‘yı dışarıya aktarmak ihtiyacı doğduğunda kullanılır. Bu sayede kurallar dışarıdan izole edilerek işletilir ve kod okuma işi kolaylaşır.
Strategy Pattern: Policy Pattern olarak da bilinen bu kalıp, run time’da bir sınıfın içerisindeki behavior’un ya da algoritmanın değiştirilmek istendiğinde uygulanabilir. İçerisinde çeşitli strajejiler bulunduran ve her bir stratejiye karşılık gelen contect objeler bulunduran yeni objeler üretilir. Strategy objeler, context objeler içerisindeki algoritmaların çalışma şeklini değiştirerek çalıştırır.
Composite Pattern: Bildiğimiz composite design pattern’in modellenmiş bir domain içerisinde uygulanmasıdır. Burada dikkat edilmesi gereken nokta, client tarafında dışarıdan tamamen soyutlandırılmış composite objeler kullanmalıdır.
Application Architecture
Fonksiyonelite açısından zengin domainler tasarlıyorsak, domain modellerinin alt yapıdan ve kuracağımız mimariden soyutlanmış olması gerekir. Örnek olarak katmanlı mimariler domain’i sistemin diğer kısımlarından izole etmek için kullanılabilir.
Her katman, yalnızca altındaki katmanlardan haberdardır. Bu sayede daha düşük bir seviyedeki bir katman, üstündeki bir katmanı çağıramaz. Ayrıca, her katman bir biri ile uyumludur ve belirli bir katmanda yer alan sınıflar katmanın amacına ve sorumluluğuna uygun davranmaya dikkat ederler.
 
User Interface: User Interface’lerin oluşturumasından ve domain model ile etkileşimlerinden sorumludur.
Application: Domain ile nasıl çalışılacağı hakkında fikir veren ince bir katmandır.
Domain: Fonsiyonelite açısından zengin, domain’in kolay anlaşılabilir bir modelidir. Repository’ler ve factory’ler bu katmanın birer üyeleri kabul edilseler de çoğu ORM araçları tarafından altyapı katmanına ait üyeler olarak kabul görmektedirler.
Infrastructure: Teknolojiye özel kararlara odaklanılır, amaçtan ziyade implementasyon kısmı ile ilgilenilir. Bu katmanda domain’lerin instance’ları yaratılabilir. Ancak genellikle repository’ler bu katmanla etkileşim içerisinde olurlar.


 
Katmanlar arayüzlerle tasarlanmalı ve katmanlar arası etkileşim bu arayüzler üzerinden olmalıdır. Ayrıca, transactionlar domain katmanı üzerinden yönetilmelidir.
Disadvantages
Eric Evans ve Microsoft, DDD’ın ancak çok sayıda kompleks domain’in var olduğu bir projede kullanılmasının doğru olduğunu savunmaktadırlar.
Ekip ürün geliştirme sürecinin sürekliliği için kurmuş olduğu dili sürekli iyileştirmelidir ve olabildiğince domain’ler içerisinde izole etmek için efor harcamalıdır.
Tutarlılık ve bütünlüğü sağlamak oldukça maliyetlidir.
Yazılım geliştirme ekibi business kuralları Domain expert’lerden öğrenmek durumundadırlar. Bu durumda yetkin bir domain expert ile çalışmak zorundadırlar.
OOP kurallarına hakim yetkin bir yazılım ekibi gerektirmektedir.
Domain expert’ler ile developerlar arasında güçlü bir iletişim olması gerektirmektedir.

.Net Application Domain 	(GITHUB)  (test)
.Net Application Domain Nedir
An application domain is a virtual process and is used to isolate applications from one another. Each application domain has their own virtual address space which scopes the resources for the application domain using that address space.
Each application running within its main process boundaries and its application domain boundaries. All objects created within the same application scope are created within the same application domain. Multiple application domains can exist in a single operating system process. An application running inside one application domain cannot directly access the code running inside another application domain.
System.AppDomain is the main class you can use to deal with application domains.

-
An application domain is the segment of reality for which a software system is developed. It is the background or starting point for the actual-state analysis and the creation of a domain model.
An application domain can be an organization, a department within an organization, or a single workplace.
The concept of an application domain is at least as wide, so that the domain concepts and relations relevant for the construction of models can be well understood during the analysis of the actual state of the domain. On the other hand, its extent should always be limited, that is, never be too complex.
An application domain normally includes a domain-specific language. This means that people in this domain use specific terms and concepts and think about their domain in a specific way.

T-SQL (Transact-SQL)	(GITHUB)  (test)
T sql nedir, t-sql nedir
Microsoft SQL Server veritabanı için kullanılan sorgulama diline verilen isimdir. Oracle veritabanında kullanılan SQL ile arasında komut farkları bulunmaktadır. 
Transact-SQL provides the following statements to declare and set local variables: DECLARE, SET and SELECT.
DECLARE @var1 NVARCHAR(30);
SET @var1 = 'Some Name';
SELECT @var1 = Name
  FROM Sales.Store
  WHERE CustomerID = 100;

SQL tarafında değişken deklare edebildiğin, değişkene değer atayabildiğin bir ortamdır T-SQL. If else bile kullanabilirsin:
IF DATEPART(dw, GETDATE()) = 7 OR DATEPART(dw, GETDATE()) = 1
   PRINT 'It is the weekend.';
ELSE
   PRINT 'It is a weekday.';


BEGIN and END mark a block of statements. If more than one statement is to be controlled by the conditional in the example above, we can use BEGIN and END like this:


IF DATEPART(dw, GETDATE()) = 7 OR DATEPART(dw, GETDATE()) = 1
BEGIN
   PRINT 'It is the weekend.';
   PRINT 'Get some rest on the weekend!';
END;
ELSE
BEGIN
   PRINT 'It is a weekday.';
   PRINT 'Get to work on a weekday!';
END;

SQL, düzeltilmesi veya değiştirilmesi istenen bilgileri açıkça belirtmeye izin veren ve yerine getirilebilecek başlıca işlemleri tanımlamamızı sağlayan bir komut takımıdır. Bu komutların oluşturduğu yapıya T-SQL dili denir. T-SQL ile veri ve sorgulara erişebilir, güncelleyebilir ve ilişkisel veri tabanı sistemi yönetilebilir. T-SQL komutları kullanım amaçlarına göre üç genel kategoriye ayrılır.
Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is Microsoft's and Sybase's proprietary extension to the SQL (Structured Query Language) used to interact with relational databases. T-SQL expands on the SQL standard to include procedural programming, local variables, various support functions for string processing, date processing, mathematics, etc. and changes to the DELETE and UPDATE statements.
Transact-SQL is central to using Microsoft SQL Server. All applications that communicate with an instance of SQL Server do so by sending Transact-SQL statements to the server, regardless of the user interface of the application.
Stored procedures in SQL Server are executable server-side routines. The advantage of stored procedures is the ability to pass parameters.

Elasticsearch	(GITHUB)  (test)
Elastic search nedir, elasticsearch nedir
Detaylı bilgi: http://www.borakasmer.com/elasticsearch-nedir/
ElasticSearch, BigData yani büyük veriler ile çalışan şirketlerin, adından da anlaşılacağı gibi içerik arama, veri analizi, sorgulamalar ve öneriler gibi işlemlerde özellikle performans kabiliyetleri, güçlü ve esnek olmasından dolayı tercih ettiği bir search engine’dir. Kimdir bu büyük şirketler LinkedIn, Stack Overflow, Foursquare, GitHub, Amazon. ElasticSearch, java dili ile geliştirilmiş, “Lucene” altyapısı üzerine oturtulmuş open-source bir arama motorudur. Tabi ki boşuna bu dev teknoloji şirketleri tarafından kullanılmamaktadır.
Visual Studio .Net tarafında NEST kütüpahanesi ile bu güçlü arama motoru kolayca implemente edilebilmektedir. 
Elasticsearch is a search engine based on the Lucene library. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents. Elasticsearch is developed in Java. Following an open-core business model, parts of the software are licensed under various open-source licenses (mostly the Apache License)[2], while other parts[3] fall under the commercial (source-available) Elastic License. Official clients are available in Java, .NET (C#), PHP, Python, Apache Groovy, Ruby and many other languages.[4] According to the DB-Engines ranking, Elasticsearch is the most popular enterprise search engine followed by Apache Solr, also based on Lucene.[5]
Elasticsearch can be used to search all kinds of documents. It provides scalable search, has near real-time search, and supports multitenancy. "Elasticsearch is distributed, which means that indices can be divided into shards and each shard can have zero or more replicas. Each node hosts one or more shards, and acts as a coordinator to delegate operations to the correct shard(s). Rebalancing and routing are done automatically".[4] Related data is often stored in the same index, which consists of one or more primary shards, and zero or more replica shards. Once an index has been created, the number of primary shards cannot be changed.

Hadoop nedir, apache hadoop nedir
Apache Hadoop is a collection of open-source software utilities that facilitate using a network of many computers to solve problems involving massive amounts of data and computation. It provides a software framework for distributed storage and processing of big data using the MapReduce programming model. Originally designed for computer clusters built from commodity hardware[3]—still the common use—it has also found use on clusters of higher-end hardware. All the modules in Hadoop are designed with a fundamental assumption that hardware failures are common occurrences and should be automatically handled by the framework.

Fuzzy Search	(GITHUB)  (test) 
Fuzzy search nedir
A fuzzy search is a process that locates Web pages that are likely to be relevant to a search argument even when the argument does not exactly correspond to the desired information. A fuzzy search is done by means of a fuzzy matching program, which returns a list of results based on likely relevance even though search argument words and spellings may not exactly match. Exact and highly relevant matches appear near the top of the list. Subjective relevance ratings, usually as percentages, may be given.
A fuzzy matching program can operate like a spell checker and spelling-error corrector. For example, if a user types "Misissippi" into Yahoo or Google (both of which use fuzzy matching), a list of hits is returned along with the question, "Did you mean Mississippi?" Alternative spellings, and words that sound the same but are spelled differently, are given. A fuzzy matching program can compensate for common input typing errors, as well as errors introduced by optical character recognition ( OCR ) scanning of printed documents. The program can return hits with content that contains a specified base word along with prefixes and suffixes. For example, if "planet" is entered as a search word, hits occur for sites containing words such as "protoplanet" or "planetary." The program can also find synonyms and related terms, working like an online thesaurus or encyclopedic cross-reference tool. In the Ask Jeeves search engine, if the word "galaxy" is entered, hits are returned such as "Galaxy Photography," "Milky Way," and "The Nine Planets Solar System Tour."
Fuzzy matching programs usually return irrelevant hits as well as relevant ones. Superfluous results are likely to occur for terms with multiple meanings, only one of which is the meaning the user intends. If the user has only a vague or general idea of the topic, or does not know exactly what to look for, the ratio of relevant hits to irrelevant hits tends to be low. (The ratio is even lower, however, when an exact matching program is used in this situation.)
Fuzzy searching is much more powerful than exact searching when used for research and investigation. Fuzzy searching is especially useful when researching unfamiliar, foreign-language, or sophisticated terms, the proper spellings of which are not widely known. Fuzzy searching can also be used to locate individuals based on incomplete or partially inaccurate identifying information.

DevOps	   (GITHUB)  (test) 
Devops nedir

DevOps is a set of software development practices that combines software development (Dev) and information technology operations (Ops) to shorten the systems development life cycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently in close alignment with business objectives.
Agile and DevOps both often utilize practices such as automated build and test, continuous integration, and continuous delivery. Agile can be viewed as addressing communication gaps between customers and developers, while DevOps addresses gaps between developers and IT operations / infrastructure.[24][unreliable source?] Also, DevOps has focus on the deployment of developed software, whether it is developed via Agile or other methodologies.
DevOps, kurumların uygulama ve hizmetleri yüksek hızda sunmanın yanı sıra ürünleri geleneksel yazılım geliştirme ve altyapı yönetimi süreçlerini kullanan kurumlara göre daha hızlı geliştirme becerisini artıran kültürel felsefelerin, uygulamaların ve araçların birleşimidir. Bu hız, kurumların müşterilerine daha iyi hizmet sunmasına ve piyasada daha etkili bir şekilde rekabet etmesine imkan tanır.
DevOps Nasıl Çalışır
Bir DevOps modelinde geliştirme ve operasyon ekipleri artık “silolu” değildir. Bazen bu iki ekip tek bir ekip altında birleştirilir ve ekipteki mühendisler geliştirme ve testten dağıtım ve operasyona kadar bir uygulamanın yaşam döngüsünün tamamında çalışır ve tek bir işlevle kısıtlı olmayan bir dizi beceri edinir.
Bazı DevOps modellerinde kalite güvencesi ve güvenlik ekipleri de uygulamanın yaşam döngüsü boyunca geliştirme ve operasyon ekibiyle sıkı bir entegrasyon içinde olur. Bir DevOps ekibindeki herkes güvenliğe odaklanıyorsa buna bazen DevSecOps denir.
Bu ekipler, süreçleri kullanarak eskiden el ile gerçekleştirilen ve yavaş olan süreçleri otomatikleştirir. Uygulamaları hızla ve güvenilir bir şekilde çalıştırıp geliştirmelerine yardımcı olan bir teknoloji yığınını ve araçları kullanırlar. Ayrıca, bu araçlar mühendislerin normalde diğer ekiplerden yardım almasını gerektirecek görevleri (örneğin, kod dağıtma veya altyapı tedarik etme) bağımsız olarak yapmasına yardımcı olarak ekiplerin hızını daha da artırır.

DOM / Document Object Model	(GITHUB)  (test)
Dom nedir, document object model nedir
İnternet tarayıcıları girilen internet sayfasını bir belge, bu belge (sayfa) içerisinde bulunan tüm elemanları da nesne olarak kabul eder. Buna göre resim, yazı, form gibi tüm elemanlar nesnedir. İşte DOM sayfa içindeki herhangi bir nesnenin özelliğine müdahele edebilmemize, nesne özelliklerini değiştirebilmemize olanak sağlar. Bunu yapabilmek için de JavaScript gibi bazı script dilleri kullanmamız gerekir.
1. yöntem
Doğrudan resim nesnesinin etiketi üzerinde scripti çalıştırabiliriz.
  <img src="resim.jpg" border="1" onMouseOver="this.style.border='1px solid red'" onMouseOut="this.style.border='1px solid blue'">
2. yöntem
İlk olarak web sayfasımızın <head>etiketi</head> arasına (tavsiye edilir, zorunlu değildir) ya da herhangi bir yerine aşağıdaki betiği yazmamız gerekir.
The Document Object Model is an application programming interface (API) for valid HTML and well-formed XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated. In the DOM specification, the term "document" is used in the broad sense - increasingly, XML is being used as a way of representing many different kinds of information that may be stored in diverse systems, and much of this would traditionally be seen as data rather than as documents. Nevertheless, XML presents this data as documents, and the DOM may be used to manage this data.
With the Document Object Model, programmers can build documents, navigate their structure, and add, modify, or delete elements and content. Anything found in an HTML or XML document can be accessed, changed, deleted, or added using the Document Object Model, with a few exceptions - in particular, the DOM interfaces for the XML internal and external subsets have not yet been specified.

Cross-platform nedir, cross platform nedir, multi platform nedir, multi-platform nedir
For example, a cross-platform application may run on Microsoft Windows, Linux, and macOS. Cross-platform programs may run on as many as all existing platforms, or on as few as two platforms. Cross-platform frameworks (such as Qt, Flutter, NativeScript, Xamarin, Phonegap, Ionic, and React Native) exist to aid cross-platform development.
Platform can refer to the type of processor (CPU) or other hardware on which a given operating system or application runs, the type of operating system on a computer or the combination of the type of hardware and the type of operating system running on it.[4] An example of a common platform is Microsoft Windows running on the x86 architecture. Other well-known desktop computer platforms include Linux/Unix and macOS - both of which are themselves cross-platform.

Redux  (GITHUB)  (test) 
Redux nedir
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/07/redux-designers-guide/

Let’s say we are building a Dribbble shot page. What is the data we want to display on the page? They include the author’s profile photo, name, the animated GIF, the number of hearts, the comments, and so on.
 
Data on a Dribbble shot page (Large preview)
First, we need to fetch all these data from a server in the cloud and put it somewhere. Next, we need to actually display the data. We need to assign pieces of this data to corresponding UI elements that represent what we actually see in the browser. For example, we assign the URL of the profile photo to the src attribute of an HTML img tag:
<img src='https://url/to/profile_photo'>
Copy
Finally, we need to handle changes to the data. For example, if a user adds a new comment to a Dribbble shot, or adds a star, we need to update the HTML accordingly.
Coordinating these three aspects of state is a big part in front-end development, and React has various degree of support for this task. Sometimes the built-in facility in React works well enough. But as the app grows more complex, its state may become harder to manage with React alone. That’s why many people start using Redux as an alternative.

Integration testing    (GITHUB)  (test) 
integration nedir, integration testing nedir
Integration testing (sometimes called integration and testing, abbreviated I&T) is the phase in software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group. Integration testing is conducted to evaluate the compliance of a system or component with specified functional requirements.[1] It occurs after unit testing and before validation testing. Integration testing takes as its input modules that have been unit tested, groups them in larger aggregates, applies tests defined in an integration test plan to those aggregates, and delivers as its output the integrated system ready for system testing.[2]
Approach
Some different types of integration testing are big-bang, mixed (sandwich), risky-hardest, top-down, and bottom-up. Other Integration Patterns[3] are: collaboration integration, backbone integration, layer integration, client-server integration, distributed services integration and high-frequency integration.
In the big-bang approach, most of the developed modules are coupled together to form a complete software system or major part of the system and then used for integration testing. This method is very effective for saving time in the integration testing process. However, if the test cases and their results are not recorded properly, the entire integration process will be more complicated and may prevent the testing team from achieving the goal of integration testing.
Bottom-up testing is an approach to integrated testing where the lowest level components are tested first, then used to facilitate the testing of higher level components. The process is repeated until the component at the top of the hierarchy is tested. All the bottom or low-level modules, procedures or functions are integrated and then tested. After the integration testing of lower level integrated modules, the next level of modules will be formed and can be used for integration testing. This approach is helpful only when all or most of the modules of the same development level are ready. This method also helps to determine the levels of software developed and makes it easier to report testing progress in the form of a percentage.
Top-down testing is an approach to integrated testing where the top integrated modules are tested and the branch of the module is tested step by step until the end of the related module.
Sandwich testing is an approach to combine top down testing with bottom up testing.
One limitation to this sort of testing is that any conditions not stated in specified integration tests, outside of the confirmation of the execution of design items, will generally not be tested.

Automated Testing   (GITHUB)  (test) 
Automated Testing   nedir

Well, I can only speak of my opinions and experiences, and I'm just a developer who has worked quite a bit with testers and QA engineers. Anyway, my 2c:
The most basic difference manual is done by hand, and automatic is done by computer :) As a consequence, the manual test process can be orders of magnitude slower than an fully automated one. On the other hand, automated tests can only detect issues they were meant to detect, and cannot detect fundamentally new behaviour of a system. That basically means that automated tests are ideal for regression testing, when it is well known what should be done, how, and what the outputs should be.
As to the skill sets, manual tests can be basically made by anyone in the right mindset, while automated tests must be made by someone with at least some developer experience. There are frameworks that enable easy recording of a automated web tests, for example, but, it's often necessary to tweak the recorded scenarios to better suit the needs of the testing. Of course, the necessary basic skills for testing must also be present in anyone wanting a work in QA, like patience, attention to detail, great organizational abilities, great communication abilities, etc...
And last, I don't thinks manual testing is underrated, if anything, I think automated testing is underused in most corporate environments I've seen. But, yes, some people (mostly managers, to be honest) do interpret my previous paragraph as "anyone can do manual tests".
-
Automated testing (especially automated unit testing) is good because it means that you can test earlier in the development cycle and you can keep testing regularly; it allows the developers to identify where they have made errors before involving the QA team. But that doesn't mean that QA is unnecessary. Apart from the matter of ensuring that the automated tests are themselves suitable, there's also the matter of working out whether the application is doing what it should; it's pretty rare for that to be understood entirely.
It's also difficult to automatically test user interfaces. For example, assessing whether an icon is suitably meaningful and positioned nicely is a matter for people not computers, because the computer doesn't care but the user does.
-
The Main Advantage with Automated Testing is that you can do regression testing quickly.. Developer can verify previous functionality, if it is working fine or not after adding new functionalities into the System.
So when you are working with a tight deadline then by using Automation tools you can reduce you testing effort.. so at that time you have to check only those functionality for which you haven't created automated test scripts. ( Like Email/SMS notifications Testing, Browser Compatibility/UI etc etc.)
Today many companies are using Open Source Automation Tools (Like Selenium, OpenSTA, JMeter etc) for their normal testing efforts. So it's better if you know how to test an application using these freeware tools instead of paid tools.

Test Automation   (GITHUB)  (test) 
Test Automation nedir
Software Test automation makes use of specialized tools to control the execution of tests and compares the actual results against the expected result. Usually, regression tests, which are repetitive actions, are automated.
Testing Tools not only helps us to perform regression tests but also helps us to automate data set up generation, product installation, GUI interaction, defect logging, etc. Automation tools are used for both Functional and Non-Functional testing.
Criteria for Tool Selection:
For automating any application, the following parameters should be considered:
•	Data driven capabilities
•	Debugging and logging capabilities
•	Platform independence
•	Extensibility & Customizability
•	E-mail Notifications
•	Version control friendly
•	Support unattended test runs
Types of Frameworks:
Typically, there are 4 test automation frameworks that are adopted while automating the applications:
•	Data Driven Automation Framework
•	Keyword Driven Automation Framework
•	Modular Automation Framework
•	Hybrid Automation Framework
Popular Tools that are used for Functional automation:

Acceptance test–driven development   (GITHUB)  (test) 
Acceptance test–driven development nedir
Acceptance test–driven development (ATDD) is a development methodology based on communication between the business customers, the developers, and the testers.[1] ATDD encompasses many of the same practices as specification by example (SBE),[2][3] behavior-driven development (BDD),[4] example-driven development (EDD),[5] and support-driven development also called story test–driven development (SDD).[6] All these processes aid developers and testers in understanding the customer's needs prior to implementation and allow customers to be able to converse in their own domain language.
ATDD is closely related to test-driven development (TDD).[7] It differs by the emphasis on developer-tester-business customer collaboration. ATDD encompasses acceptance testing, but highlights writing acceptance tests before developers begin coding.
Overview
Acceptance tests are from the user's point of view – the external view of the system.[1] They examine externally visible effects, such as specifying the correct output of a system given a particular input. Acceptance tests can verify how the state of something changes, such as an order that goes from "paid" to "shipped". They also can check the interactions with interfaces of other systems, such as shared databases or web services. In general, they are implementation independent, although automation of them may not be.[8][9]
Creation
Acceptance tests are created when the requirements are analyzed and prior to coding.[1] They can be developed collaboratively by requirement requester (product owner, business analyst, customer representative, etc.), developer, and tester. Developers implement the system using the acceptance tests. Failing tests provide quick feedback that the requirements are not being met. The tests are specified in business domain terms. The terms then form a ubiquitous language that is shared between the customers, developers, and testers.[10] Tests and requirements are interrelated.[11] A requirement that lacks a test may not be implemented properly. A test that does not refer to a requirement is an unneeded test. An acceptance test that is developed after implementation begins represents a new requirement.[12]
Testing strategy
Acceptance tests are a part of an overall testing strategy. They are the customer tests that demonstrate the business intent of a system. Component tests are technical acceptance tests developed by an architect that specify the behavior of large modules. Unit tests are created by the developer to drive easy-to-maintain code.[13] They are often derived from acceptance tests and unit tests. Cross-functional testing includes usability testing,[14] exploratory testing,[15] and property testing (scaling and security).[16]
Acceptance criteria and tests
Acceptance criteria are a description of what would be checked by a test. Given a requirement such as "As a user, I want to check out a book from the library", an acceptance criterion might be, "verify the book is marked as checked out". An acceptance test for this requirement gives the details so that the test can be run with the same effect each time.
Test format
Acceptance tests usually follow this form:[1]
Given (setup)
A specified state of a system
When (trigger)
An action or event occurs
Then (verification)
The state of the system has changed or an output has been produced
Also, it is possible to add Statements that start with AND in any of the sections below (Given, When, Then).
For the example requirement, the steps could be listed as:
Given Book that has not been checked out
And User who is registered on the system
When User checks out a book
Then Book is marked as checked out
Complete test
The previous steps do not include any specific example data, so that is added to complete the test:
Given:
Book that has not been checked out
Books	
Title	Checked out
Great book	No
User who is registered on the system
Users
Name	Sam
When:
User checks out a book
Checkout action
User	Sam	Checks out	Great book
Then:
Book is marked as checked out
Books
Title	Checked out	User
Great book	Yes	Sam
Test examination
Examination of the test with specific data usually leads to many questions. For the sample, these might be:
•	What if the book is already checked out?
•	What if the book does not exist?
•	What if the user is not registered on the system?
•	Is there a date that the book is due to be checked-in?
•	How many books can a user check out?
These questions help illuminate missing or ambiguous requirements. Additional details such as a due-date can be added to the expected result. Other acceptance tests can check that conditions such as attempting to check out a book that is already checked out produces the expected error.
Another test example
Suppose the business customer wanted a business rule that a user could only check out one book at a time. The following test would demonstrate that:
Scenario: Check that checkout business rule is enforced
Given:
Book that has been checked out
Books
Title	Checked out	User
Great book	Yes	Sam
Another great book	No	
Users
Name
Sam
When:
User checks out another book
Checkout action
User	Sam	Checks out	Another great book
Then:
Error occurs
Error occurred
Description
Violation of checkout business rule
Project acceptance tests
In addition to acceptance tests for requirements, acceptance tests can be used on a project as a whole.[1] For example, if this requirement was part of a library book checkout project, there could be acceptance tests for the whole project. These are often termed SMART objectives. An example test is "When the new library system is in production, the users will be able to check books in and out three times as fast as they do today".

Big Data Management    (GITHUB)  (test) 
Big data management nedir
The term "big data" usually refers to data stores characterized by the "3 Vs": high volume, high velocity and wide variety.

Big data management is a broad concept that encompasses the policies, procedures and technology used for the collection, storage, governance, organization, administration and delivery of large repositories of data. It can include data cleansing, migration, integration and preparation for use in reporting and analytics.
Big data management is closely related to the idea of data lifecycle management (DLM). This is a policy-based approach for determining which information should be stored where within an organization's IT environment, as well as when data can safely be deleted.
Big Data Management Cycle
The Data Lifecycle. Source: DataONE
Within a typical enterprise, people with many different job titles may be involved in big data management. They many include a chief data officer (CDO), chief information officer (CIO), data managers, database administrators, data architects, data modelers, data scientists, data warehouse managers, data warehouse analysts, business analysts, developers and others.
Big Data Management Challenges
In the IDG 2016 Data and Analytics Survey, 90 percent of those surveyed said they had experienced challenges related to big data management. Several different factors make big data management more challenging than managing smaller repositories of data. Common issues include the following:
Data silos: Within most organizations, different departments and business units use different applications and store information in separate databases. These separate databases may include similar information, but the data isn't always consistent from one database to another. For example, a retailer may store customer addresses in a marketing database, a customer service database, an accounting database and an ecommerce website database. If just one of those databases has slightly different information for a particular customer — such as listing a customer's street address as an "avenue" when the other databases list it as a "street" — it could lead to problems like duplicate mailings, losing track of customer service records, double billing or inaccurate reporting. In addition, storing the same piece of information in several different locations eats up storage space — particularly when the problem is multiplied across an entire customer base.
And unfortunately, siloed data is a very common problem for enterprises. The 2016 Enterprise Data Management Survey from Unisphere Research found that 59 percent of those surveyed had very little or only a few of their data systems integrated while most data still resided in siloes.
Growing data stores: Managing big data is also difficult because of the sheer size of the data involved, compounded by the fact that it keeps getting bigger. In the customer address example above, fixing the customer records would be fairly easy for a very small company with only a hundred customers. In that case, someone could just look at the records involved and fix them. But for a national retailer with millions of customers and multiple petabytes worth of data, a different solution is necessary.
In some cases, simply moving data around, say from a database into an analytics solution, can take a long time because of the large quantities involved. And performing any sort of operations on that data can slow performance to a crawl.
Data and architectural complexity: Not only is enterprise data stored in disparate siloes and constantly growing, today's data can be extremely complex. Enterprises often have both structured data (data that resides in a database) and unstructured data (data contained in text documents, images, video, sound files, presentations, etc.), and that data resides in a wide variety of different formats. A single enterprise may have thousands of applications on its systems, and each of those applications may read from and write to many different databases. As a result, simply cataloging what kinds of data an organization has in its storage systems can be a very difficult job.
Ensuring data quality: All of these challenges make it very difficult for enterprises to ensure that their data is reliable and accurate. As already mentioned above, the lack of synchronization across data silos can make it difficult for managers to know which piece of data is correct. But data quality is also affected by another big problem — human error.
In the Experian study, 56 percent of those surveyed said that human error was the biggest challenge that affected their data accuracy. Everyone makes mistakes when typing. But when a data-driven organization is using information typed by humans as the basis for major business decisions, simple typos could have potentially disastrous consequences.
Inadequate staffing: Another big issue complicating big data management is a lack of trained staff. There simply aren't enough data scientists and other big data professionals to fill all the available positions. As a result, salaries tend to be quite high. According to Indeed.com, the current average salary for a data scientist is $130,235, while a data warehouse engineer typically makes $112,607. By comparison, software engineers, which are generally some of the best paid employees in an IT department, earn an average of $100,512. Clearly, the demand for big data skills exceeds the available supply.
Lack of executive support: Another potential challenge for big data management efforts is senior managers who do not understand the importance and value of good data management. Flashier technologies like predictive analytics and artificial intelligence may get a lot of attention — and budget — while the mundane processes of moving and cleaning data don't generate as much excitement.
However, this problem appears to be diminishing somewhat. In the Experian study, the number of respondents citing inadequate senior management support as a big challenge to data management diminished from 21 percent in 2016 to 19 percent in 2017. And in the NewVantage Partners Big Data Executive Survey 2017, 52.5 percent of executives said that data governance was critically important to big data business adoption.
Establishing a data-friendly culture: For any organization, moving from a culture where people made decisions based on their gut instincts, opinions or experience to a data-driven culture marks a huge transition. The NewVantage study found that 52.5 percent of executives pointed to "organizational impediments" as a reason they had failed to achieve the goals of their big data projects, and only 27.9 percent of those surveyed said that they had been successful in their efforts to establish a data-driven culture. Changing the mindset of employees and managers takes time, but most experts agree that it is necessary for big data management to be effective.

WebPack             (GITHUB)  (test) 
Webpack nedir
webpack is an open-source JavaScript module bundler. It is made primarily for JavaScript, but it can transform front-end assets such as HTML, CSS, and images if the corresponding loaders are included.[7] webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.[8]

Webpack takes the dependencies and generates a dependency graph allowing web developers to use a modular approach for their web application development purposes. It can be used from the command line, or can be configured using a config file which is named webpack.config.js. This file is used to define rules, plugins, etc., for a project. (webpack is highly extensible via rules which allow developers to write custom tasks that they want to perform when bundling files together.)
Node.js is required for using webpack.
webpack provides code on demand using the moniker code splitting. The Technical Committee 39 for ECMAScript is working on standardization of a function that loads additional code: "proposal-dynamic-import".

Flutter             (GITHUB)  (test) 
Flutter nedir 
Flutter is Google’s portable UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively-compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
Flutter apps are written in the Dart language and make use of many of the language's more advanced features.[9]
On Windows, macOS, and Linux[10] Flutter runs in the Dart virtual machine, which features a just-in-time execution engine. While writing and debugging an app, Flutter uses Just In Time compilation, allowing for "hot reload", with which modifications to source files can be injected into a running application. Flutter extends this with support for stateful hot reload, where in most cases changes to source code are reflected immediately in the running app without requiring a restart or any loss of state.
Release versions of Flutter apps are compiled with ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation on both Android and iOS,[12] making Flutter's high performance on mobile devices possible.

Source-to-source compiler  (S2S)             (GITHUB)  (test) 
S2s nedir, source to source nedir
A source-to-source compiler (S2S compiler) is a type of compiler that takes the source code of a program written in a programming language as its input and produces the equivalent source code in the same or a different programming language. A source-to-source compiler that produces the code in a different language - a transcompiler or transpiler - may perform a translation of a program at roughly the same level like from Pascal to C, while a traditional compiler translates from a language like C to assembler or Java to bytecode. An automatic parallelizing compiler will frequently take in a high level language program as an input and then transform the code and annotate it with parallel code annotations (e.g., OpenMP) or language constructs (e.g. Fortran's forall statements).
Another purpose of source-to-source-compiling is translating legacy code to use the next version of the underlying programming language or an API that breaks backward compatibility. It will perform automatic code refactoring which is useful when the programs to refactor are outside the control of the original implementer (for example, converting programs from Python 2 to Python 3, or converting programs from an old API to the new API) or when the size of the program makes it impractical or time consuming to refactor it by hand.

TypeScript             (GITHUB)  (test) 
Typescript nedir
TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript.[4] As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs.
TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side execution (as with Node.js or Deno). There are multiple options available for transcompilation. Either the default TypeScript Checker can be used,[5] or the Babel compiler can be invoked to convert TypeScript to JavaScript.

Refactoring, kodun işlevselliğini değiştirmeden, kodun kalitesinin artırılması sürecidir. Evet refactoring bir süreçtir. Her ne kadar amaç/niyet her zaman en baştan temiz kod yazmak olsa da, (her ne kadar yazarken en temiz şekilde yazılsa da) değişen ve gelişen kodların zaman içerisinde sürekli optimize edilmesi gerekecektir.
Refactoring nasıl yapılır?	
Refactoring yaparken, yapılacak olanların bir sıralamaya göre yapılması önemlidir. Ayrıca diğer bir önemli konu ise bu işi belirli bir ritimle yapmak önemlidir. Yani sırası ile yapılacak olan her küçük değişiklikten sonra test yapmak gerekir. Küçük değişikler, test, küçük değişiklikler, test, … gibi bir ritimle bu işi yapmak en basit ve garantili yoldur. Refactoring’in tanımında da bahsedildiği gibi, amacımız kodun işlevselliğinde hiçbir değişiklik yapmadan, kodların kalitesini en optimum seviyeye getirmek.Kodun işlevselliğinin değişmediğini garanti etmenin en iyi yolu da elbette test yazmaktır.

Kanban, 2000’li yılların başlarında ilk kez David J. Anderson tarafından uygulanan, karakteristik özelliklerini Yalın Üretim (Lean Production) ilkerinden (özellikle Taiichi Ohno’nun 1953 yılında Toyota’da uygulamaya başladığı yalın üretim metodu kanbandan) alan ve Kısıtlar Teorisi (Theory of Constraints) yanında Sistemsel Düşünme (Systems Thinking) gibi sistemik optimize yaklaşımlarını barındıran evrimsel bir metodolojidir.
İlk başlangıçta süregelen sistemi değiştirmeden izleyerek, çöp üreten ve bekleme yaratan noktaların görselleştirilerek tespit edilmesini ve sonrasında yok edilmesi ile sistemi iyileştirmeyi ve hafifletmeyi amaçlar. Bu hafifleme ve yalınlaşma ile organizasyon daha çevik tepkiler verebilecektir. Evrimsel oluşundan dolayı diğer uygulamalarda yaşanabilecek organizasyon kültüründen kaynaklı negatif tepkiler en düşük seviyede gözlemlenir.
Kanban organizasyon içiresindeki değişime belirlenmiş temel ilkerin anlatımı ve genel pratiklerin uygulaması ile başlar. İlk uygulama adımlarının efektifliği ve bu uygulamalar sonucunda elde edilen değerin yüksek olmasından dolayı Kanban‘ın tek amacının sistemi görselleştirmek ve işi sınırlamak olduğu gibi bir kanı oluşmuştur. Kanban‘ın asıl amacı; gerçek bir “pull” sistemi oluşturup, “Ertelenmiş Taahhüt” (Deferred Commitment) olgusunu benimsemiş “Tam Zamanında Üretim” (JIT Delivery) yapabilen istikrarlı bir sistem yaratmaktır.

Fedora is a Linux distribution developed by the community-supported Fedora Project which is sponsored primarily by Red Hat, a subsidiary of IBM, with additional support from other companies.[11] Fedora contains software distributed under various free and open-source licenses and aims to be on the leading edge of free technologies.[12][13][14] Fedora is the upstream source of the commercial Red Hat Enterprise Linux distribution, and subsequently CentOS as well.
Since the release of Fedora 30, five different editions are currently available: Workstation, focused on the personal computer, Server for servers, CoreOS, focused on cloud computing, Silverblue, focused on an immutable desktop specialized to container-based workflows and IoT, focused on IoT devices.
As of February 2016, Fedora has an estimated 1.2 million users,[17] including Linus Torvalds (as of 2015), creator of the Linux kernel.
Features
Fedora has a reputation for focusing on innovation, integrating new technologies early on and working closely with upstream Linux communities.[14][20] Making changes upstream instead of specifically for Fedora ensures that the changes are available to all Linux distributions.
Fedora has a relatively short life cycle: each version is usually supported for at least 13 months, where version X is supported only until 1 month after version X+2 is released and with approximately 6 months between most versions.[21] Fedora users can upgrade from version to version without reinstalling.
The default desktop environment in Fedora is GNOME and the default user interface is the GNOME Shell. Other desktop environments, including KDE Plasma, Xfce, LXDE, MATE, Deepin and Cinnamon, are available and can be installed.

Nhibernate nedir, hibernate nedir
Hibernate, Java platformunda yazılmış bir ORM aracıdır (Object/Relational Mapping). 
ORM, nesne odaklı (object oriented) dillerdeki nesnelerin, ilişkisel veri tabanlarındaki (relational databases) kayıtlara nasıl karşılık geldiğini yürüten bir teknolojidir. NHibernate adında .NET çatısı için yeniden yazılmış bir türevi bulunur.
Hibernate gibi ORM araçlarıyla, bir nesneyi veri tabanına kaydetmek, yeni halini güncellemek ve sorgulama yapmak düz SQL bağlantılarına göre çok kolaydır.
Örneğin, JDBC ile veri tabanına bir kayıt eklemek için şuna benzer bir kod yazılır:
stmt.executeUpdate( "INSERT INTO KAHVE VALUES ('Colombian', 101, 7.99, 0, 0)");
Burada, "KAHVE" tablosuna bir kayıt eklenmekte. Böyle bir işlemi Hibernate ile yapmak için:
session.saveOrUpdate(kahve);
kahve, bildiğimiz düz bir Java nesnesidir (POJO).
Hibernate gibi ORM araçlarının en önemli faydası, kod yazımını kısaltmak veya kolaylaştırmaktan öte, yazılım bakımını kolaylaştırmasıdır. Veri tabanı temelli uygulamalarda, kodun 1/3´ü veri tabanı erişimine yöneliktir. Veri tabanındaki bir kolonunun tipinin değişmesi, yeni bir kolon eklenmesi gibi değişiklikler, bütün veri erişim kodunu tekrar gözden geçirmeyi gerektirir. Hibernate ile bu gözden geçirmeden çok yüksek oranda tasarruf edilir. Hibernate kullanılan yazılımlarda, veri tabanındaki değişikliklerde yapılması gereken sadece nesnelerle tabloların birbirine nasıl eşleştirildiğinin (mapping) gözden geçirilmesidir.

Hibernate ORM (or simply Hibernate) is an object-relational mapping tool for the Java programming language. It provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a relational database. Hibernate handles object-relational impedance mismatch problems by replacing direct, persistent database accesses with high-level object handling functions.
Hibernate is free software that is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License 2.1.
Hibernate's primary feature is mapping from Java classes to database tables, and mapping from Java data types to SQL data types. Hibernate also provides data query and retrieval facilities. It generates SQL calls and relieves the developer from the manual handling and object conversion of the result set.
Mapping
The mapping of Java classes to database tables is implemented by the configuration of an XML file or by using Java Annotations. When using an XML file, Hibernate can generate skeleton source code for the persistence classes. This is auxiliary when annotations are used. Hibernate can use the XML file or the Java annotations to maintain the database schema.
There are provided facilities to arrange one-to-many and many-to-many relationships between classes. In addition to managing associations between objects, Hibernate can also manage reflexive associations wherein an object has a one-to-many relationship with other instances of the class type.
Hibernate supports the mapping of custom value types. This makes the following scenarios possible:
Overriding the default SQL type when mapping a column to a property.
Mapping Java Enums to columns as though they were regular properties.
Mapping a single property to multiple columns.
Definition: Objects in an object-oriented application follow OOP principles, while objects in the back-end follow database normalization principles, resulting in different representation requirements. This problem is called "object-relational impedance mismatch". Mapping is a way of resolving the object-relational impedance mismatch problem.
Mapping informs the ORM tool of what Java class object to store in which database table.

WebSocket             (GITHUB)  (test) 
Websocket nedir
HTTP stateless request/response protokolüdür. Http protokülünün bu yapısı çok fazla etkileşim içerisinde olan web uygulamaları için uygun değildir. HTTP 1.1’den önce her request servera yeni bir connection yaratılırdı. HTTP 1.1 ile birlikte birden çok request/response çifti için tek bir tcp connection’ı kullanılabilir hale geldi. Bu yeni yapı http-keep alive ya da http persistent connection olarak adlandırılır. Http half duplex,tek yönlü bir protokoldür. Yani request’in yönü server’dan client’a doğrudur.
Server’da bir değişiklik olduğunda server bunu client’a bildiremez. Bu değişikliği algılayabilmek için polling, long polling ya da websocket  gibi yapılar kullanılır. Polling belli aralıklarla belli zaman aralıklarında server’a request yapılır, server her request için response’u oluşturup gönderir. Bu yöntem çok fazla trafik yaratır.
Long polling, server requesti alır hemen response oluşturmaz yeni data oluşana kadar bekletir daha sonra response’u gönderir. Websocket tek bir tcp connectionu üzerinden çift yönlü ve full duplex mesajlaşmayı sağlar. Websocket ile birlikte clienttan request gelmesine gerek olmadan server’daki değişiklikler client’a iletilebilir. Full duplex iki yönlü simultane iletişime izin verir.

WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. The WebSocket protocol was standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455 in 2011, and the WebSocket API in Web IDL is being standardized by the W3C.
WebSocket is distinct from HTTP. Both protocols are located at layer 7 in the OSI model and depend on TCP at layer 4. Although they are different, RFC 6455 states that WebSocket "is designed to work over HTTP ports 443 and 80 as well as to support HTTP proxies and intermediaries," thus making it compatible with the HTTP protocol. To achieve compatibility, the WebSocket handshake uses the HTTP Upgrade header[1] to change from the HTTP protocol to the WebSocket protocol.
The WebSocket protocol enables interaction between a web browser (or other client application) and a web server with lower overhead than half-duplex alternatives such as HTTP polling, facilitating real-time data transfer from and to the server. This is made possible by providing a standardized way for the server to send content to the client without being first requested by the client, and allowing messages to be passed back and forth while keeping the connection open. In this way, a two-way ongoing conversation can take place between the client and the server. The communications are usually done over TCP port number 443 (or 80 in the case of unsecured connections), which is of benefit for those environments which block non-web Internet connections using a firewall. Similar two-way browser-server communications have been achieved in non-standardized ways using stopgap technologies such as Comet.
Most browsers support the protocol, including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari and Opera.
Overview
Unlike HTTP, WebSocket provides full-duplex communication.[2][3] Additionally, WebSocket enables streams of messages on top of TCP. TCP alone deals with streams of bytes with no inherent concept of a message. Before WebSocket, port 80 full-duplex communication was attainable using Comet channels; however, Comet implementation is nontrivial, and due to the TCP handshake and HTTP header overhead, it is inefficient for small messages. The WebSocket protocol aims to solve these problems without compromising the security assumptions of the web.
The WebSocket protocol specification defines ws (WebSocket) and wss (WebSocket Secure) as two new uniform resource identifier (URI) schemes[4] that are used for unencrypted and encrypted connections, respectively. Apart from the scheme name and fragment (i.e. # is not supported), the rest of the URI components are defined to use URI generic syntax.[5]
Using browser developer tools, developers can inspect the WebSocket handshake as well as the WebSocket frames.[6]
History
WebSocket was first referenced as TCPConnection in the HTML5 specification, as a placeholder for a TCP-based socket API.[7] In June 2008, a series of discussions were led by Michael Carter that resulted in the first version of the protocol known as WebSocket.[8]
The name "WebSocket" was coined by Ian Hickson and Michael Carter shortly thereafter through collaboration on the #whatwg IRC chat room,[9] and subsequently authored for inclusion in the HTML5 specification by Ian Hickson, and announced on the cometdaily blog by Michael Carter.[10] In December 2009, Google Chrome 4 was the first browser to ship full support for the standard, with WebSocket enabled by default.[11] Development of the WebSocket protocol was subsequently moved from the W3C and WHATWG group to the IETF in February 2010, and authored for two revisions under Ian Hickson.[12]
After the protocol was shipped and enabled by default in multiple browsers, the RFC was finalized under Ian Fette in December 2011.[13]
Browser implementation
A secure version of the WebSocket protocol is implemented in Firefox 6,[14] Safari 6, Google Chrome 14,[15] Opera 12.10 and Internet Explorer 10.[16] A detailed protocol test suite report[17] lists the conformance of those browsers to specific protocol aspects.
An older, less secure version of the protocol was implemented in Opera 11 and Safari 5, as well as the mobile version of Safari in iOS 4.2.[18] The BlackBerry Browser in OS7 implements WebSockets.[19] Because of vulnerabilities, it was disabled in Firefox 4 and 5,[20] and Opera 11.[21]

Web server implementation
Nginx has supported WebSockets since 2013, implemented in version 1.3.13 [30] including acting as a reverse proxy and load balancer of WebSocket applications.[31]
Internet Information Services added support for WebSockets in version 8 which was released with Windows Server 2012.[32]
Protocol handshake
To establish a WebSocket connection, the client sends a WebSocket handshake request, for which the server returns a WebSocket handshake response, as shown in the example below.[33]
Client request (just like in HTTP, each line ends with \r\n and there must be an extra blank line at the end):
GET /chat HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Key: x3JJHMbDL1EzLkh9GBhXDw==
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat, superchat
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
Origin: http://example.com
Server response:
HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Accept: HSmrc0sMlYUkAGmm5OPpG2HaGWk=
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat
The handshake starts with an HTTP request/response, allowing servers to handle HTTP connections as well as WebSocket connections on the same port. Once the connection is established, communication switches to a bidirectional binary protocol which does not conform to the HTTP protocol.
In addition to Upgrade headers, the client sends a Sec-WebSocket-Key header containing base64-encoded random bytes, and the server replies with a hash of the key in the Sec-WebSocket-Accept header. This is intended to prevent a caching proxy from re-sending a previous WebSocket conversation,[34] and does not provide any authentication, privacy, or integrity. The hashing function appends the fixed string 258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11 (a UUID) to the value from Sec-WebSocket-Key header (which is not decoded from base64), applies the SHA-1 hashing function, and encodes the result using base64.[35]
Once the connection is established, the client and server can send WebSocket data or text frames back and forth in full-duplex mode. The data is minimally framed, with a small header followed by payload.[36] WebSocket transmissions are described as "messages", where a single message can optionally be split across several data frames. This can allow for sending of messages where initial data is available but the complete length of the message is unknown (it sends one data frame after another until the end is reached and marked with the FIN bit). With extensions to the protocol, this can also be used for multiplexing several streams simultaneously (for instance to avoid monopolizing use of a socket for a single large payload).[37]
Security considerations
Unlike regular cross-domain HTTP requests, WebSocket requests are not restricted by the Same-origin policy. Therefore WebSocket servers must validate the "Origin" header against the expected origins during connection establishment, to avoid Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking attacks (similar to Cross-site request forgery), which might be possible when the connection is authenticated with Cookies or HTTP authentication. It is better to use tokens or similar protection mechanisms to authenticate the WebSocket connection when sensitive (private) data is being transferred over the WebSocket.[38] A live example of vulnerability was seen in 2020 in the form of Cable Haunt.

Proxy traversal
WebSocket protocol client implementations try to detect if the user agent is configured to use a proxy when connecting to destination host and port and, if it is, uses HTTP CONNECT method to set up a persistent tunnel.
While the WebSocket protocol itself is unaware of proxy servers and firewalls, it features an HTTP-compatible handshake thus allowing HTTP servers to share their default HTTP and HTTPS ports (443 and 80) with a WebSocket gateway or server. The WebSocket protocol defines a ws:// and wss:// prefix to indicate a WebSocket and a WebSocket Secure connection, respectively. Both schemes use an HTTP upgrade mechanism to upgrade to the WebSocket protocol. Some proxy servers are transparent and work fine with WebSocket; others will prevent WebSocket from working correctly, causing the connection to fail. In some cases, additional proxy server configuration may be required, and certain proxy servers may need to be upgraded to support WebSocket.
If unencrypted WebSocket traffic flows through an explicit or a transparent proxy server without WebSockets support, the connection will likely fail.[39]
If an encrypted WebSocket connection is used, then the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) in the WebSocket Secure connection ensures that an HTTP CONNECT command is issued when the browser is configured to use an explicit proxy server. This sets up a tunnel, which provides low-level end-to-end TCP communication through the HTTP proxy, between the WebSocket Secure client and the WebSocket server. In the case of transparent proxy servers, the browser is unaware of the proxy server, so no HTTP CONNECT is sent. However, since the wire traffic is encrypted, intermediate transparent proxy servers may simply allow the encrypted traffic through, so there is a much better chance that the WebSocket connection will succeed if WebSocket Secure is used. Using encryption is not free of resource cost, but often provides the highest success rate since it would be travelling through a secure tunnel.
A mid-2010 draft (version hixie-76) broke compatibility with reverse proxies and gateways by including eight bytes of key data after the headers, but not advertising that data in a Content-Length: 8 header.[40] This data was not forwarded by all intermediates, which could lead to protocol failure. More recent drafts (e.g., hybi-09[41]) put the key data in a Sec-WebSocket-Key header, solving this problem.

DHTML  (Dynamic HyperText Markup Language)              (GITHUB)  (test) 
Dhtml nedir
Dynamic HTML, or DHTML, is a collection of technologies used together to create interactive and animated websites[1] by using a combination of a static markup language (such as HTML), a client-side scripting language (such as JavaScript), a presentation definition language (such as CSS), and the Document Object Model (DOM).[2] The application of DHTML was introduced by Microsoft with the release of Internet Explorer 4 in 1997. Today, references to unobtrusive JavaScript coding (DOM Scripting) have replaced the usage of the term DHTML.
DHTML allows scripting languages to change variables in a web page's definition language, which in turn affects the look and function of otherwise "static" HTML page content, after the page has been fully loaded and during the viewing process. Thus the dynamic characteristic of DHTML is the way it functions while a page is viewed, not in its ability to generate a unique page with each page load.
By contrast, a dynamic web page is a broader concept, covering any web page generated differently for each user, load occurrence, or specific variable values. This includes pages created by client-side scripting, and ones created by server-side scripting (such as PHP, Python, JSP or ASP.NET) where the web server generates content before sending it to the client.
DHTML is differentiated from Ajax by the fact that a DHTML page is still request/reload-based. With DHTML, there may not be any interaction between the client and server after the page is loaded; all processing happens in JavaScript on the client side. By contrast, an Ajax page uses features of DHTML to initiate a request (or 'subrequest') to the server to perform additional actions. For example, if there are multiple tabs on a page, pure DHTML approach would load the contents of all tabs and then dynamically display only the one that is active, while AJAX could load each tab only when it is really needed.

WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)              (GITHUB)  (test) 
Wpf nedir
İsminden ne olduğu anlaşılıyor: Windows PRESENTATİON Foundation. Yani tasarımla, görüntüyle ilgili bişey…
Wpf, Microsoft tarafından geliştirilen, Windows Presentation Foundation kelimelerinin baş harflerinden oluşturulmuş yeni bir görsel tasarım sistemidir. 
WPF, yazılım tasarımında gelişen teknolojiyle birlikte modern grafik kartlarının sunduğu avantajlardan faydalanarak daha etkileyici, aynı zamanda işlevsel görsel tasarımların oluşturulmasına imkan verir.
Tasarımlar XAML (eXtensible Application Markup Language) adı verilen XML benzeri bir işaretleme dili ile oluşturulur. Microsoft’un geliştirdiği WPF teknolojisi ve XAML dili, Oracle’ın geliştirdiği JavaFX teknolojisi ve FXML dili birbiriyle benzer niteliklere sahip rakip teknolojilerdir.

WPF yeni nesil kullanıcı arayüzü geliştirme ve görüntüleme platformudur. Bu yeni platformun sağlamış olduğu yeni özellikler ile görsel olarak daha modern ,kullanıcı ile daha etkileşimli, içerik sunumunda daha esnek, uygulamalarda kullanılan ses ve görüntü lerin daha kolay bir şekilde gösterilmesi ve zengin içerikli uygulamaların kolay ve hızlı bir şekilde geliştirilmesi sağlanmaktadır. WPF’in mimarisinden dolayı çalıştığı sistem üzerindeki donanımı yoğun işlemlerde dahi en etkin biçimde kullanarak performans konusunda tatmin edici sonuçlar vermektedir.
WPF in getirdiği yeniliklerin başında uygulama geliştirme aşamasında kod yazmak yerine günüzmüzde birçok firmanın ürününde sık sık karşılaştığımız deklaratif programlama ile (ASP.NET ile ilgilenenlerin yakından bildiği gibi) uygulama geliştirme imkanı sağlamasıdır. XML’e benzer yapısı ile XAML (eXtensible Application Markup Language ) dilini kullanarak(zamel olarak telaffuz edilir), HTML kullanarak hazırladığımız arayüzlerdeki gibi WPF’de de kolaylıkla esnek kullanıcı arayüzleri oluşturabiliriz. Tabi ki eskiden kullanılan yöntem yani kod ile uygulama arayüzü geliştirme (imperative programming) desteği de halen devam etmektedir. XAML dili ile programcı ve tasarımıcı arasındaki bağımlılığı ortadan kaldırmaktır. Tasarımcı XAML dilini kullanarak arayüzü oluşturacak, programcı ise çalışaması gereken kodları yazacak, uygulamanın sonunda da programıcının kodları ile tasarımcının hazırladığı arayüz birleştirilerek uygulama hazır hale getirilecek. Oysa bundan önceki programlama modelinde kullanıcı arayüzünü geliştirmek kod ile gerçekleştiğinden arayüzün hazırlanması ve kodların yazımı tamamen programcının sorumluluğunda olan bir durumdu.

HTML (HyperText Markup Language)             (GITHUB)  (test) 
Html nedir
Html web sayfaları hazırlamak için kullanılan bir işaretleme dilidir. Halihazırda kullandığımız web tarayıcıları (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome v.b) bu kodları anlayarak görsel web sayfalarına dönüştürürler. Html bir programlama dili değildir.
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and <input /> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)             (GITHUB)  (test) 
Css nedir
CSS, “Cascading Style Sheets” kelimelerinin kısaltılmasından oluştur ve türkçe anlamı Basamaklı Stil Şablonları ya da Basamaklı Biçim Sayfaları şeklindedir.
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]
The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5]
In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.

XML (eXtensible Markup Language)             (GITHUB)  (test) 
Xml nedir
XML, interneti kullanarak veri alışverişi yapan sistemler ve platformlar arasındaki veri iletişimini standart hale getirmek için tasarlanan bir işaretleme dilidir. İngilizcesi eXtensible Markum Language olan XML, Türkçeye Genişletilebilir İşaretleme Dili olarak girmiştir. XML’in çıkış tarihi Microsoft’un .Net teknolojisinin çıkış tarihiyle kesiştiği için bir çok kişi tarafından Microsoft tabanlı bir teknoloji olarak bilinmektedir. Fakat sanılanın aksine bu teknoloji W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) tarafından tasarlanan bir veri iletişim standardıdır.
XML’ e neden ihtiyaç duyulmuştur?
XML standardı ortaya çıkmadan önce, bir yazılımda veya veritabanında kullanılan verilerin başka bir platforma taşınması sırasında birçok problemle karşılaşılıyordu. İletilen bilgi kümesindeki veri yapısının, diğer sistemdeki yapıya uygun hale getirilmesi işlemi uzun zaman alıyor ve karmaşık süreçler gerektiriyordu. Ayrıca tasarlanan bu sistem ve fonksiyonların işlem sonucunda başka alanlarda kullanılması mümkün olmuyordu. Bu durumun önlenmesi amacıyla standart bir veri iletim teknolojisinin geliştirilmesi gerekliliği üzerine XML dili ortaya çıkmıştır.
XML’in temel özellikleri nelerdir?
XML, HTML gibi hiyerarşik bir işaretleme dilidir. Ancak XML’de kullanılan etiketler, HTML’den farklı olarak kişiler tarafından belirlenir. İsimlendirme konusunda insiyatifi bize bırakan XML, diğer konularda katı ve kesin kurallara sahiptir.
 
Bir XML dosyası oluşturulurken aşağıdaki kurallara uyulması gerekir.
XML etiketleri hiyerarşik bir yapıda oluşturulmalıdır.
Açılan etiketler mutlaka kapatılmalıdır.
XML’ de etiketlere nitelik atanabilir.
Xml Case Sensitive bir dildir.
XML dilini nerelerde kullanabilirim?
XML dili günümüzde veri iletimiyle alakalı her alanda sıklıkla kullanılmaktadır. Günümüzde web siteleri için site haritası oluşturma, veritabanlarının aktarılması, yazılım paketleri içerisindeki bağımlılıkların tanımlanması, finansal verilerin iletimi, dosya sistemlerinin oluşturulması, bilimsel içeriklerin depolanması gibi yüzlerce alanda XML teknolojisi kullanılmaktadır.

Material Design   (GITHUB)  (test) 
Material Design nedir
Material Design (codenamed Quantum Paper)[1] is a design language that Google developed in 2014. Expanding on the "card" motifs that debuted in Google Now, Material Design uses more grid-based layouts, responsive animations and transitions, padding, and depth effects such as lighting and shadows.
Google announced Material Design on June 25, 2014, at the 2014 Google I/O conference.
Overview
Designer Matías Duarte explained that, "unlike real paper, our digital material can expand and reform intelligently. Material has physical surfaces and edges. Seams and shadows provide meaning about what you can touch." Google states that their new design language is based on paper and ink but implementation takes place in an advanced manner.
Material Design will gradually be extended throughout Google's array of web and mobile products, providing a consistent experience across all platforms and applications. Google has also released application programming interfaces (APIs) for third-party developers to incorporate the design language into their applications.[5][6][7] The main purpose of material design is creation of new visual language that combines principles of good design with technical and scientific innovation.
In 2018, Google detailed a revamp of the language, with a focus on providing more flexibility for designers to create custom "themes" with varying geometry, colors, and typography. Google released Material Theme Editor exclusively for the macOS design application Sketch.[8][9]
Implementation
As of 2020, most of Google's mobile applications for Android as well as its web app counterparts had applied the new design language, including Gmail, YouTube, Google Drive, Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides, Google Photos, Google Maps, Google Classroom, Google Translate, Google Chrome, Google Keep, Google Play, and most other Google products. It is also the primary design language of Android and Chrome OS.
In 2018, with the introduction of the ability to create custom themes, Google also began redesigning most of their apps into a customized and adapted version of Material Design called the Google Material Theme[10], also dubbed "Material Design 2"[11], which heavily emphasized white space, rounded corners, colorful icons, bottom navigation bars, and utilized a special size-condensed version of Google's proprietary Product Sans font called Google Sans.[12] As of 2020, most Google applications have also applied the new Google Material Theme design, with the notable exception of YouTube.
The canonical implementation of Material Design for web application user interfaces is called Polymer.[13] It consists of the Polymer library, a shim that provides a Web Components API for browsers that do not implement the standard natively, and an elements catalog, including the "paper elements collection" that features visual elements of the Material Design.[14]

Design language / Design Vocabulary          (GITHUB)  (test) 
Design language nedir
A design language or design vocabulary is an overarching scheme or style that guides the design of a complement of products or architectural settings.
Objectives
Designers wishing to give their suite of products a unique but consistent look and feel define a specification for it, which can describe choices for design aspects such as materials, colour schemes, shapes, patterns, textures, or layouts. They then follow the scheme in the design of each object in the suite.
Usually, design languages are not rigorously defined; the designer basically makes one thing in a similar manner as another. In other cases, they are followed strictly, so that the products gain a strong thematic quality. For example, although there is a great variety of unusual chess set designs, the pieces within a set are usually thematically consistent.
Sometimes, designers encourage others to follow their design languages when decorating or accessorizing.
Industrial design
In automobiles, the design language is often in the grille design. For instance, many BMW vehicles share a design language,[1] including front-end styling consisting of a split "kidney grille" and four circular headlights. Some manufacturers have appropriated design language cues from rival firms.
Software
In software architecture, design languages are related to architecture description languages. The most well known design language is Unified Modeling Language.[citation needed]
In the context of graphical user interfaces, for example, human interface guidelines can be thought of as design languages for applications.

Look And Feel          (GITHUB)  (test) 
Look and feel nedir
In software design, the look and feel of a graphical user interface comprises aspects of its design, including elements such as colors, shapes, layout, and typefaces (the "look"), as well as the behavior of dynamic elements such as buttons, boxes, and menus (the "feel"). The term can also refer to aspects of a non-graphical user interface (such as a command-line interface), as well as to aspects of an API – mostly to parts of an API that are not related to its functional properties. The term is used in reference to both software and websites.
Look and feel applies to other products. In documentation, for example, it refers to the graphical layout (document size, color, font, etc.) and the writing style. In the context of equipment, it refers to consistency in controls and displays across a product line.
Look and feel in operating system user interfaces serves two general purposes. First, it provides branding, helping to identify a set of products from one company. Second, it increases ease of use, since users will become familiar with how one product functions (looks, reads, etc.) and can translate their experience to other products with the same look and feel.

WCF (Windows Communication Foundation)              (GITHUB)  (test) 
wcf nedir
Windows Communication Foundation WCF, servis-yönelimli mimariyi temel alarak dağıtık-uygulamalar geliştirmek için kullanılan, dağıtık mimari modelleri ve teknolojileri tek çatı altında birleştiren ve içerisinde bir çok hazır bileşen barındıran bir Framework API‘sidir. (Bknz. Service Oriented Architecture)
Yazılım dünyasında aynı anda birden fazla sistem üzerinde çalışan dağıtık uygulamalar söz konusu olduğunda bu uygulamaların iletişim altyapısını WCF katmanında belirleyebilmekte ve bu işlemi diğer (.Net Remoting, XML Web Servisleri vs.) gibi teknolojilere nazaran daha kapsamlı ve hızlı icra edebilmekteyiz.
WCF, az kod yazarak birçok işlevi hızlı bir şekilde gerçekleştirmemizi sağlayan ve bir başka deyişle .NET teknolojisinde herşeyi herşeye bağlamaya yarayan bir teknolojidir. WCF’in en büyük getirisi, servis içine işlediğiniz iş mantığının dışa açarken göz önüne alacağınız yöntemlerden bağımsız olmasıdır. Yani demem o ki, bu gün HTTP üzerinden çalışan bir port yarın ufak bir değişiklikle TCP ile çalıştırılabilir. Bu tarz ayarlar implementasyon sonrası sağlanabilmektedir.
Peki hoca! Bu anlattıklarını Web Service ile de yapamaz mıyız? diye sorduğunuzu duyar gibiyim. Bu sorunuza kısmen cevabını vermek daha doğru olacaktır. Çünkü Web Service yukarıda bahsettiğim gibi tüm portları kullanamamakta sade ve sadece HTTP portu üzerinden işlem yapmaktadır. Ama WCF böyle mi? Hemen hemen tüm portları desteklemektedir. Vee farklar sadece bu kadar mı? Tabi ki de hayır. Web Service ile WCF arasındaki diğer farklarıda aşağıda ele alalım;
Web Serviceler sadece IIS üzerinde host edilebilirler. WCF ise IIS, WAS, Console Application, Windows NT Services üzerinde host edilebilmektedir.
Web Servicelerde güvenlik oldukça sınırlıdır. Kimlik doğrulama ve yetkilendirme işlemleri IIS kullanılarak yapılır. WCF ise her bir protokol için ayrı bir güvenlik hizmeti sağlar.
Anlayacağınız WCF, Web Servicelerden daha kapsamlıdır.
WCF’i anlamak için WCF’in ABC’sini anlamak lazımdır. Peki nedir bu ABC?
Address(Adres)
WCF iletişim katmanını kullanacak uygulamaların doğru kaynakla irtibata girebilmesi için adres bilgisidir.
Binding(Bağlayıcı)
İletişim protokolüdür.
Contract(Kontrat)
İletişim katmanına bağlı uygulamaların, WCF üzerinde hangi yapılara yahut fonksiyonalitelere erişebileceğini belirleyen bir kontrattır.
Yani bu ABC kısaca, dağıtık uygulamaların ve WCF’in süreçteki response ve request trafiğindeki “Nereye?(Address)”, “Nasıl(Binding)” ve “Neyi(Contract) sorularına yanıtları vermektedir.

WCF stands for Windows Communication Foundation. It is basically used to create a distributed and interoperable Application. WCF Applications came into the picture in .Net 3.0 Framework. This is a framework, which is used for creating Service oriented Applications. You can send the data asynchronously from one end point to another. I think you all know about Web Service and are thinking, if we already have Web Services and accessing on a remote basis then why did WCF come into picture?
There are so many reasons for it but now I am giving you an answer in two words- one is protocol and the other is hosting. Thus, I will explain these two words later in this article.
Distributed Application

It means those Applications, which do not run only on single system but can run on multiple systems, which are connected over the network. For example, a Web Service that can consume by different clients.

Interoperable
It means that an Application can consume or connect with another Application but it does not matter in which platform it is developed.

Example

Web Service is interoperable because it can be consume from any client, either it is from Java or .NET but on a remote basis, it is not interoperable because if we want to consume any remote service from the client, client Application must be developed in .NET.

Why we need WCF Applications

In this, I am explaining why we need WCF Application, if we already have Web Service.

Suppose, you have two clients- one wants to use a Web Service, which sends data over the network, using Http protocol and want reply in XML format, so we will create a Web Service.

The other wants to send the data, using Web Service over the network, using TCP protocol and replying in binary format, then we need to implement a remote Web service with TCP protocol.

Problem

The problem is in the example, shown above, we need to create two different Services for two different clients .WCF is solving this problem and one single service can be consumed by two different clients- either they want same protocol or a different protocol. We specify the protocol name in an endpoint attribute of the Web Service.

WCF

There are three parts of WCF Application or we can say it consists of three things, which are-

•	WCF Service : What is the service and what it is providing.
•	WCF Service host: Where is the Service hosted.
•	Service Client: Who is the client of the Service.
Fundamentals of WCF

Message

Message is the communication unit, as it is in the form of an envelop. The transmission of the data from the client to Service and Service to client is being done by envelop. The envelop or message has the sections, given below-
•	Header 
•	Body
By default Header and fault are disabled but Body is responsible for the data transmission or data exchanging.
Header is useful to send some data from client to Server. Suppose we want to send user name from each request but don’t want to send it by an argument, we can easily add it into message header.
Endpoint
Endpoint is a very essential part of WCF Application, as it describes the address of Web Service from where a user can receive and send the message. It also specifies the communication mechanism of how the message will be sent or received.
End point consists of three things, which are A,B,C and each of them have a question mark.
•	Address (Where?)
•	Binding (how?)
•	Contract (What?)
Endpoint = A + B+ C

Address is the address of WCF Service, where the Service is hosted? It gives the exact URL of Web Service, where the Service hosts the pattern of URL, which is-

Scheme://domain/[:port]/path
net.tcp://localhost:1234/MyService
http://localhost:1234/MyService

Binding
It describes the way or mechanism by which the user will communicate with Web Service. It constitutes some binding element, which creates the structure of communication such as some transport protocols like HTTP, TCP etc. Message format or security techniques etc.

Contract
 
Contract is the third important question. What functionality and operation is being provided by  the service is called contract. It specifies what functionality and operations are need to be exposed to the client. It is the interface name which has all operation that need to be exposed.

Hosting

Hosting is the important thing in WCF Application and it makes WCF Application different from other distributed Applications. WCF supports following types of hosting-

•	IIS Hosting
•	Self hosting 
•	WAS hosting
SOAP

SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol. It is not a transport protocol but an  XML based message protocol.

Distributed System / Distributed Computing / Dağıtık Sistemler              (GITHUB)  (test) 
Dağıtık sistem nedir, dağıtık sistemler nedir, Distributed System nedir, distributed computing nedir0
İsme dikkat: Distributed.. Yani dağıtılmış… Ne dağıtılır? Görev dağıtılır…
Birbirinden bağımsız ancak bir ağ üzerinden haberleşerek uyumlu bir biçimde tek bir hesaplama birimi gibi çalışan bilgisayarlar topluluğudur.
A distributed system, also known as distributed computing, is a system with multiple components located on different machines that communicate and coordinate actions in order to appear as a single coherent system to the end-user.
Overview
The machines that are a part of a distributed system may be computers, physical servers, virtual machines, containers, or any other node that can connect to the network, have local memory, and communicate by passing messages.
There are two general ways that distributed systems function:
Each machine works toward a common goal and the end-user views results as one cohesive unit.
Each machine has its own end-user and the distributed system facilitates sharing resources or communication services.
Although distributed systems can sometimes be obscure, they usually have three primary characteristics: all components run concurrently, there is no global clock, and all components fail independently of each other.
Benefits and challenges of distributed systems
There are three reasons that teams generally decide to implement distributed systems:
Horizontal Scalability—Since computing happens independently on each node, it is easy and generally inexpensive to add additional nodes and functionality as necessary.
Reliability—Most distributed systems are fault-tolerant as they can be made up of hundreds of nodes that work together. The system generally doesn’t experience any disruptions if a single machine fails.
Performance—Distributed systems are extremely efficient because work loads can be broken up and sent to multiple machines.
However, distributed systems are not without challenges. Complex architectural design, construction, and debugging processes that are required to create an effective distributed system can be overwhelming.
Three more challenges you may encounter include:
Scheduling—A distributed system has to decide which jobs need to run, when they should run, and where they should run. Schedulers ultimately have limitations, leading to underutilized hardware and unpredictable runtimes.
Latency—The more widely your system is distributed, the more latency you can experience with communications. This often leads to teams making tradeoffs between availability, consistency, and latency.
Observability—Gathering, processing, presenting, and monitoring hardware usage metrics for large clusters is a significant challenge.
How a Distributed System Works
Hardware and software architectures are used to maintain a distributed system. Everything must be interconnected—CPUs via the network and processes via the communication system.
Types of distributed systems
Distributed systems generally fall into one of four different basic architecture models:
Client – server — Clients contact the server for data, then format it and display it to the end-user. The end-user can also make a change from the client-side and commit it back to the server to make it permanent.
Three-tier—Information about the client is stored in a middle tier rather than on the client to simplify application deployment. This architecture model is most common for web applications.
n-tier—Generally used when an application or server needs to forward requests to additional enterprise services on the network.
Peer-to-peer—There are no additional machines used to provide services or manage resources. Responsibilities are uniformly distributed among machines in the system, known as peers, which can serve as either client or server.
Example of a Distributed System
Distributed systems have endless use cases, a few being electronic banking systems, massive multiplayer online games, and sensor networks.
StackPath utilizes a particularly large distributed system to power its content delivery network service. Every one of our points of presence (PoPs) has nodes that form a worldwide distributed system. And to provide top notch content delivery, StackPath stores the most recently and frequently requested content in edge locations closest to the location it is being used.
Distributed systems at the edge
With StackPath’s edge compute services, virtual machines, and containers, users can create their own distributed systems. By interconnecting VMs and containers, while also leveraging the speed and agility that comes with edge computing, your system can handle thousands of simultaneous requests at lightning-fast speed.
Key Takeaways
Distributed systems can be made up of any machine capable of connecting to a network, having local memory, and communicating by passing messages.
By spreading out requests and workloads, distributed systems can support far more requests and compute jobs than a standard single system.
You can create your own lightning-fast distributed system by interconnecting StackPath’s edge computing containers and virtual machines.

Bütün bilgisayar sistemlerinde temelde iki iş yaparız: Veri saklama (storage) ve hesaplama (computation). Ve günün sonunda hedefimiz bir problemi çözmektir. Bazen bu problemin doğası ve/veya büyüklüğü bizi birden fazla bilgisayar kullanmaya zorlar. İşte bu noktada “dağıtık programlama” devreye girer.
Dağıtık programlama, bir bilgisayar ile çözebileceğiniz bir sorunu birden fazla bilgisayar kullanarak çözmeye çalışma sanatıdır.
Burada akla ilk gelen soru “Madem bir bilgisayarla çözebiliyorduk neden birden fazla bilgisayar kullanıyoruz?” olacaktır. Aslında elimizde sonsuz işlem yapma gücünde, sonsuz veri saklama kapasitesinde ve Dünya’nın her noktasından hızlıca erişilebilir bir bilgisayar olsaydı dağıtık sistemler kurmaya gerek kalmazdı. Fakat böyle bir bilgisayar yok. Bizim işimizi görecek kadarını yapsak bize yeter diye düşünebilirsiniz. Orada da şöyle bir sorun devreye giriyor: Dağıtık sistemler kurmak yerine elimizdeki donanımların özelliklerini arttırdıkça bu donanımların maaliyetleri aşırı yükseliyor. Aşağıdaki görselde de görüleceği üzere makina sayısını arttırarak yatayda ölçekleme yapmanın (horizontal scaling/scale out) maaliyeti lineer artarken, makinanın özelliklerini artırarak dikeyde ölçekleme yapmanın (vertical scaling/scale up) maaliyeti üssel şekilde artıyor.
 
Kaldı ki donanım öğelerinin de fiziksel limitleri ve bozulma ihtimali var. Milyon dolarlar harcadığınız bir sistemin tek bir donanım öğesinin (disk, memory, cpu vb.) bozulmasıyla çalışamaz hale gelmesini kabul eder miydiniz? Edenleri şuraya alalım. Etmeyenlerle “Nasıl şu dağıtık sistemleri kurarız?” derdine düşelim hep beraber.

1 liraya 1 çokomel alabiliyorum. 2 liraya 2 tane alabilirim. Hatta toplu alsam belki 20 liraya 25 tane alabilirim. Peki bu dağıtık sistemlerde de böyle mi? 1 makina ile 100 birim iş yapabiliyor isem 10 makina ile 1000 işlem yapabilir miyim?
Dağıtık sistemlerde makina adeti ile toplam işlem gücü arasındaki ilişki lineer değil maalesef. Çünkü sisteme eklenen her bir öğe sistemin karmaşıklığını arttırır ve beraberinde iletişim maaliyetleri getirir. Dolayısıyla 10 makina ile 1000 işlem yapmanız neredeyse olanaksızdır. 900 filan olursa öpüp başınıza koyun derim :)Yüksek özellikli makinalar her zaman verimli mi?

Yazıyı bitirirken yukarıdaki grafiği de açıklamak isterim. Barroso, Clidaras ve Hölzle isimli 3 Google çalışanı bir araştırma yapıyor. Araştırmada şöyle bir soru mevcut: 4 çekirdekli sıradan makinalarla mı çalışsak daha performanslı olur, yoksa high-end dedikleri 128 çekirdekli makinalarla mı çalışsak daha iyi olur? Kurulan kümenin (cluster) boyutu küçükken (toplamda 512 çekirdekli iken mesela) 128’lik makinalı küme çok daha iyi. Çünkü iletişimin büyük bölümü makina içlerinde ve tahmin edersiniz ki belleğe ulaşmak (memory access) ağ üzerinden haberleşmeye göre oldukça ucuz/hızlı. Fakat kümenin boyutu büyüdükçe bu performans artışı gitgide azalıyor. Sonlara doğru %1-2 düzeylerinde gördüğünüz üzere. Yani dağıtık sistemlerde ölçek büyüdükçe sistem üzerindeki birimlerin büyüklüklerinin önemi ciddi ölçüde azalıyor. Problemi/çözümü kümeye nasıl dağıttığımıza kalıyor bütün mesele.

Separation of Concerns / SoC             (GITHUB)  (test) 
SoC nedir
In computer science, separation of concerns (SoC) is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections, so that each section addresses a separate concern. A concern is a set of information that affects the code of a computer program. A concern can be as general as the details of the hardware the code is being optimized for, or as specific as the name of a class to instantiate. A program that embodies SoC well is called a modular program. Modularity, and hence separation of concerns, is achieved by encapsulating information inside a section of code that has a well-defined interface. Encapsulation is a means of information hiding. Layered designs in information systems are another embodiment of separation of concerns (e.g., presentation layer, business logic layer, data access layer, persistence layer).
Separation of concerns results in higher degrees of freedom for some aspect of the program's design, deployment, or usage. Common among these is higher degrees of freedom for simplification and maintenance of code. When concerns are well-separated, there are higher degrees of freedom for module reuse as well as independent development and upgrade. Because modules hide the details of their concerns behind interfaces, increased freedom results to later improve or modify a single concern's section of code without having to know the details of other sections, and without having to make corresponding changes to those sections. Modules can also expose different versions of an interface, which increases the freedom to upgrade a complex system in piecemeal fashion without interim loss of functionality.
Implementation
The mechanisms for modular or object-oriented programming that are provided by a programming language are mechanisms that allow developers to provide SoC.[4] For example, object-oriented programming languages such as C#, C++, Delphi, and Java can separate concerns into objects, and architectural design patterns like MVC or MVP can separate content from presentation and the data-processing (model) from content. Service-oriented design can separate concerns into services. Procedural programming languages such as C and Pascal can separate concerns into procedures or functions. Aspect-oriented programming languages can separate concerns into aspects and objects.
Separation of concerns is an important design principle in many other areas as well, such as urban planning, architecture and information design.[5] The goal is to more effectively understand, design, and manage complex interdependent systems, so that functions can be reused, optimized independently of other functions, and insulated from the potential failure of other functions.
Common examples include separating a space into rooms, so that activity in one room does not affect people in other rooms, and keeping the stove on one circuit and the lights on another, so that overload by the stove does not turn the lights off. The example with rooms shows encapsulation, where information inside one room, such as how messy it is, is not available to the other rooms, except through the interface, which is the door. The example with circuits demonstrates that activity inside one module, which is a circuit with consumers of electricity attached, does not affect activity in a different module, so each module is not concerned with what happens in the other.

REST - Representational state transfer             (GITHUB)  (test) 
Rest nedir, rest api nedir
REST (Temsilî Durum Aktarımı; İng. Representational state transfer), Web protokolleri ve teknolojilerini kullanan bir dağıtık sistemdir. REST prensiplerini sağlayan sistemler, RESTful olarak sıfatlandırılır. Temsilî Durum Aktarımı ismindeki temsilî (İng. representational), verinin temsilini kastetmekte olup onunla ilgili durumun aktarılması olarak düşünülebilir.
SOAP ve WSDL tabanlı Web servislerine spesifikasyon olarak daha basit bir alternatif olarak geliştirilmiştir. RESTful sistemler çoğunlukla HTTP protokolü üzerinden Web tarayıcıları tarafından sayfaların transferinde de kullanılan HTTP fiilleri (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE v.s.) ile haberleşirler.
Aktarılan verinin formatı HTML, JSON, XML ya da farklı bir tipte olabilir. REST, bu konuda bir kısıtlama getirmez. Aktarılan verinin tipi ve özellikleri istemci ve sunucu tarafından HTTP protokolünde yer alan content-type (içerik tipi) ve benzeri metaveri ile tanımlanır.
What is REST?
Many publicly accessible services expose a REST API which enables a wide range of applications from web user interfaces to back-end system integration and synchronization. So what exactly is REST and what makes an API RESTful?
REST – REpresentational State Transfer
Technically, REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer (so it’s not a perfect acronym), and essentially means that it’s an architecture intended to transfer a representation of server data or state between a client and server.
There are a few detailed criteria that are considered necessary for an API to be RESTful, but the most important are that the API be:
•	Stateless
This means that there is no necessary session is held between a client and server. Data received from the server can be used by the client independently. This allows for short, discrete operations, and even offline caching of data. This makes REST a natural fit for HTTP operations in which requests are intended to be singular and short-lived.
•	Uniform
REST APIs are meant to be self-describing, uniform in their definition, and each operation separated by a different endpoint or URL. In practical terms, most REST APIs implement classic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations against a data model. This uniformity allows developers to easily learn the usage pattern of each API.
So what does a REST API look like?
Because it’s meant to be representational, let’s start with the data model that it’s meant to represent. For example, if we have an online commerce application, we’d want to define the operations for managing products in our catalog, centered around the Product model.
Each of these operations would be linked to a combination of a URL and an HTTP verb. To review, there are many HTTP verbs, but most web development uses only the GET and POST verbs for requesting a URL or posting form data, respectively. But REST uses more HTTP verbs to signal to the server what type of operation the client is performing.
 
The following is a simplified list of URLs combined with the HTTP verb that we’d use to expose the full API for managing a Product catalog:
 
The operations and URLs above are just the basic operations on a single model. REST APIs can also support very specific operations or hierarchical operations.  For example, if you wanted to send a signal to the server to reorder a supply of products, you might expose a URL like this:
/products/{id}/reorder 	 POST 	Signal to the server that you want to reorder quantities of a product {id}. The message body could be empty, or contain a data model used for detailed instructions on the reorder operation.
Or, if you wanted to dive into the product catalog and run a query to return a list of all orders for a given product, the API could expose an operation like this:
/products/{id}/orders  	 GET  	Given an {id} for a product, return all orders.
Conversely, you could expose an order-centric endpoint that allows you to list all products in the order:
/orders/{id}/products  	 GET  	Given an order {id} return all products in the order.
What does the server data look like?
While there’s no strict requirement for what type of data a REST API uses or returns, it has become a de facto standard for web-based REST APIs to use JSON as the data definition.
This is because JSON is a native format that all modern browsers can use to represent hierarchical objects. For more information on JSON, read our article What Is JSON?

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol - Basit Nesne Erişim Protokolü)              (GITHUB)  (test) 
Soap nedir
Service-oriented Architecture felsefesini pratiğe uyarlayan iki interface'den biridir. Üzerinde bulunan Universal Description Discovery and Integration (UDDI) ile birlikte hizmet yönelimli mimarinin pratikte kullanılmasını mümkün kılar.
SOAP (Basit Nesne Erişim Protokolü) dağıtık uygulamalarda ve web servislerinin haberleşmesinde kullanılmak üzere tasarlanan, RPC (Remote Procedure Call) modelini kullanan, istemci/sunucu mantığına dayalı bir protokoldür. Daha genel olarak SOAP, web üzerinden fonksiyonları kullanmak için geliştirilmiş bir sistemin XML tabanlı kurallar topluluğudur. SOAP ile ilgili bütün mesajlar XML formatında iletilir ve temel olarak bir SOAP mesajı 3 şekilde oluşabilir:
Metot Çağırımı
Cevap Mesajı
Hata Mesajı
Bir SOAP mesajının yapısı
Envelope
Bütün SOAP mesajlarının içinde olduğu elemandır. SOAP mesajına ilişkin XML belgesinin root elemanı olmak zorundadır. 
Envelope elemanı içinde Body veya Header gibi elemanlar bulunur. 
Envelope elemanının içinde her zaman bir Body elemanı vardır fakat Header elemanı olmak zorunda değildir. 
SOAP mimarisine göre eğer Envelope elemanı içinde Header elemanı varsa bu eleman Envelope elemanının içindeki ilk eleman olmalıdır. 
Soap kullanan mimarilerde kesinlikle erişim protokolü olarark TCP kullanılmalıdır.
Header
SOAP mesajlarındaki Header elemanını HTML standartlarında bulunan <Head></Head> etiketlerine benzetebiliriz. Header bölümü metot çağrımı ile doğrudan ilişkili değildir. Header bölümü ile meta-data dediğimizi bilgiler gönderilir.
Body
Body elemanı SOAP mesajının en önemli kısmını oluşturur. Body bölümünde web metotunun adı ve metotun parametrik bilgileri XML formatında gönderilir. Cevap mesajında ise metotun geri dönüş değeri Body bölgesine eklenir. metotun parametrik yapısının bu şekilde XML formatında yazılmasına SOAP Serialization denir. Son olarak hata mesajlarında ise Body bölümünde hatanın adı ve tanımı gibi bilgiler bulunur.

REST vs. SOAP             (GITHUB)  (test) 
REST and SOAP offer different methods to invoke a web service REST and SOAP offer different methods to invoke a web service. 
REST is an architectural style, while SOAP defines a standard communication protocol specification for XML-based message exchange. 
REST applications can use SOAP.
RESTful web services are stateless. A REST-based implementation is simple compared to SOAP, but users must understand the context and content being passed along, as there’s no standard set of rules to describe the REST web services interface. REST services are useful for restricted profile devices, such as mobile, and are easy to integrate with existing websites.
SOAP requires less plumbing code than REST services design. The Web Services Description Language describes a common set of rules to define the messages, bindings, operations and location of the service. SOAP web services are useful for asynchronous processing and invocation.

Source Control vs. Version Control       (GITHUB)  (test) 
Source control nedir, version control nedir
 
Every development team needs a good way to manage changes and version code in their codebases. That's why they use source control tools. Here we cover what source control is and how to choose tools.
What Is Source Control?
Source control refers to tracking and managing changes to code. This ensures that developers are always working on the right version of source code.
Source Control vs. Version Control
These two terms are used interchangeably. However, source control is specific to source code. Version control also covers large binary files and digital assets.
Yani şöyle diyebiliriz: Source Control = Source code…
What Is Source Control Management?
Source control management (SCM) refers to tools that help you keep track of your code with a complete history of changes.
Source Control vs. Source Code Management (SCM)
These two terms are also used interchangeably. However, source control is specific to tracking changes in source code. And source code management (SCM) tracks changes to a source code repository.
SCM also maintains a history of changes. This is used to resolve conflicts when merging updates from multiple developers.
Why Source Control Is Important
Source control is important for maintaining a single source of truth for development teams. Plus, using it helps facilitate collaboration and accelerates release velocity.
That’s because it allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase. They can commit and merge code without conflicts. And they can even make edits to shared code, without unknowingly overwriting each other’s work.
Looking to get the best tool free? Now you can. Try Helix Core from Perforce free for up to 5 users.Tips for SCM
Having a system is one thing. Managing it effectively is another.
Here are some tips to keep in mind.
Choose the right system. (Helix Core is a great one.)
Git Source Control Is One Popular Option
Git source control is one of the most popular options. Some teams use open source Git. Others use enterprise Git. Some popular Git source control options include GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.
Perforce also has Git tools. Helix4Git is a Git server inside a Perforce server that brings your Git source code into your pipeline. And Helix TeamHub can host Git repositories.
SCM Tools — Beyond Git
There are several other software options beyond Git.
These include the following.
Perforce Helix Core
Helix Core is a Perforce source control tool, available for free for up to 5 users. It’s especially well-suited for complex development challenges (such as game development or embedded systems development). And it scales well as teams (and files) grow.
Subversion (SVN)
Subversion is an open source version control software. It mimics some features of Concurrent Versions Systems (CVS) and was popular in the early 2000s. It’s since lost some ground to Git.
ClearCase
IBM Rational ClearCase is another SCM tool. It used to be the cutting edge of technology. However, ClearCase can impede the adoption of DevOps processes, which has led many teams to switch tools.
Team Foundation Server (TFS)
Microsoft TFS is a software tool that combines version control, issue tracking, and ALM. TFS has been used to track changes to source code for the past decade, with different options for on-premises and cloud.
Mercurial
Mercurial is another SCM tool that emerged around the same time as Git. Many teams trust Mercurial to manage large codebases and the history of legacy code.
But What’s the Best Source Control Tool?
There are so many source control tools available, you might wondering… which one is the best?
Helix Core is the best option for any team — from a small team of indie game developers to a large enterprise with 1,000s of developers working on code.
Github
Github nedir
GitHub, Inc. is an American multinational corporation that provides hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, continuous integration and wikis for every project.[4] Headquartered in California, it has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.

TFS / Team Foundation Server             (GITHUB)  (test) 
Tfs nedir
Microsoft TFS for source control has been around for more than a decade. And it has evolved a lot since its inception in 2005. There are professionals in the industry whose entire careers have been dedicated to managing TFS. Such expertise has been necessary because it was quite complicated to administer.
Hands-on management was critical to deal with database changes, service packs, and countless upgrades that added numerous small features. TFS was complicated to use, because it was created when user experience (UX) was not a top priority for Microsoft. When comes to TFS testing, there was no to what was happening. Testing in TFS steps was difficult because there was relationship between bugs and failed tests.
Microsoft TFS Project Management 
In 2012, TFS morphed into a tool that helped teams manage their software development projects using Agile. One of the primary reasons it became popular for Agile was because companies already had Microsoft licenses. It was a simple choice. This made it easier for teams to adopt and support new Agile software development process.
Microsoft also created a dedicated TFS ALM tool. This light-weight tool could manage some requirements, but it lacked a robust and flexible model that can support large-scale global teams. 
On the version control side of things, TFS has had a couple of different approaches. Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) was one centralized version control system. This system saved historical data using path-based branches created and maintained on a Windows server.
Microsoft TFS in the Cloud
Many people continue to run older on-premises versions of TFS. But Microsoft has been moving all the software it makes to the cloud. Some obvious examples include Office 365 and Azure, along with numerous smaller initiatives. For many, Microsoft’s cloud move was unexpected, but the benefits are clear. Azure has become a fast, secure, and integrated platform for Windows shops.
It seems like no one ever expected Microsoft to openly embrace open source. But when you look at it closely, it makes sense.  A big part of Microsoft’s strategy has been to win the hearts and minds of developers. Open Source has become popular with both developers and the companies they work for. As a result, Microsoft has put Git front and center in Visual Studio’s Source Code Control (SCC) integration.
TFS Evolution: What Is the Difference between VSTS and TFS?
So, TFS has morphed again. Today, VSTS (Visual Studio Team Services) is Microsoft’s Git code hosting, collaboration, and DevOps platform. It offers features comparable to other cloud-based Git tools and is the default version control system in Visual Studio. The on-premises version of VSTS is now called TFS. It looks nothing like the TFS of old. Microsoft’s GVFS (Git Virtual File System) runs on Windows servers and turns Git into a centralized, server-based system.
You can continue to use your legacy TFVC with Visual Studio and other popular VCS systems. Perforce Helix Core continues to have very strong integrations with the popular integrated development environment (IDE). Helix Core’s plugin for Visual Studio (P4VS) has been downloaded almost 400,000 times.
TFS for Source Control: Evaluating the Git Takeover
But even after all of this, yet another morph for TFS for source control may be on the horizon with Microsoft’s recent acquisition of GitHub, the actual home of open source software. Public announcements from the leadership of both companies say they will continue to operate “business as usual”, serving their respective communities.
This being said, we all know things can change quickly in the technology marketplace. It seems very likely that, at some point in the future, GitHub and VSTS will merge. It isn’t much of a stretch to think that NuGet and other tools might make their way over to this combination. It will be interesting to see how Microsoft version control will evolve.
What’s the Best Replacement for Team Foundation Server?
If you are still using an older on-premises version of Microsoft TFS, consider joining many other companies who are taking advantage of this turning point to evaluate. Is Git and the new VSTS really the right set of technologies for your team?
If you have:
Large numbers of developers.
Geographic locations.
Very large files (and a lot of them).
Automation needs.
Then Git may not be the right solution for you.
Helix Core + Git Support
TFS is like an old friend. But it’s one who wants give you handwritten directions, rather than plug an address into Google maps. It’s probably holding you back, or at least delaying your arrival.
And at this point, it isn’t just the VCS in the mix, but also Agile project management and lifecycle management. Perforce tools deliver best-in-class functionality that exceeds the comparable functionality in TFS and TFVC.

xUnit              (GITHUB)  (test) 
xUnit nedir
For the particular .NET testing framework, see xUnit.net.
xUnit is the collective name for several unit testing frameworks that derive their structure and functionality from Smalltalk's SUnit. SUnit, designed by Kent Beck in 1998, was written in a highly structured object-oriented style, which lent easily to contemporary languages such as Java and C#. Following its introduction in Smalltalk the framework was ported to Java by Kent Beck and Erich Gamma and gained wide popularity, eventually gaining ground in the majority of programming languages in current use. The names of many of these frameworks are a variation on "SUnit", usually replacing the "S" with the first letter (or letters) in the name of their intended language ("JUnit" for Java, "RUnit" for R etc.). These frameworks and their common architecture are collectively known as "xUnit". 
All xUnit frameworks share the following basic component architecture, with some varied implementation details.
Test runner: A test runner is an executable program that runs tests implemented using an xUnit framework and reports the test results.
(test runner nedir)
Test case: A test case is the most elemental class. All unit tests are inherited from here.
(test case nedir)
Test fixtures:
A test fixture (also known as a test context) is the set of preconditions or state needed to run a test. The developer should set up a known good state before the tests, and return to the original state after the tests.
Test suites
A test suite is a set of tests that all share the same fixture. The order of the tests shouldn't matter.
Test execution
The execution of an individual unit test proceeds as follows:

	setup(); /* First, we should prepare our 'world' to make an isolated environment for testing */
	...
	/* Body of test - Here we make all the tests */
	...
	teardown(); /* At the end, whether we succeed or fail, we should clean up our 'world' to 
	not disturb other tests or code */
  	
The setup() and teardown() methods serve to initialize and clean up test fixtures.
Test result formatter
A test runner produces results in one or more output formats. In addition to a plain, human-readable format, there is often a test result formatter that produces XML output. The XML test result format originated with JUnit but is also used by some other xUnit testing frameworks, for instance build tools such as Jenkins and Atlassian Bamboo.
Assertions
An assertion is a function or macro that verifies the behavior (or the state) of the unit under test. Usually an assertion expresses a logical condition that is true for results expected in a correctly running system under test (SUT). Failure of an assertion typically throws an exception, aborting the execution of the current test.
xUnit frameworks
Many xUnit frameworks exist for various programming languages and development platforms.

Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming,[citation needed] based on the concept of the procedure call. Procedures (a type of routine or subroutine) simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself. The first major procedural programming languages appeared circa 1957–1964, including Fortran, ALGOL, COBOL, PL/I and BASIC.[1] Pascal and C were published circa 1970–1972.
Computer processors provide hardware support for procedural programming through a stack register and instructions for calling procedures and returning from them. Hardware support for other types of programming is possible, but no attempt was commercially successful (for example Lisp machines or Java processors).[contradictory]
Procedures and modularity
	Main article: Modular programming

Modularity is generally desirable, especially in large, complicated programs. Inputs are usually specified syntactically in the form of arguments and the outputs delivered as return values.
Scoping is another technique that helps keep procedures modular. It prevents the procedure from accessing the variables of other procedures (and vice versa), including previous instances of itself, without explicit authorization.
Less modular procedures, often used in small or quickly written programs, tend to interact with a large number of variables in the execution environment, which other procedures might also modify.
Because of the ability to specify a simple interface, to be self-contained, and to be reused, procedures are a convenient vehicle for making pieces of code written by different people or different groups, including through programming libraries.
Comparison with other programming paradigms
Imperative programming
Procedural programming languages are also imperative languages, because they make explicit references to the state of the execution environment. This could be anything from variables (which may correspond to processor registers) to something like the position of the "turtle" in the Logo programming language.
Often, the terms "procedural programming" and "imperative programming" are used synonymously. However, procedural programming relies heavily on blocks and scope, whereas imperative programming as a whole may or may not have such features. As such, procedural languages generally use reserved words that act on blocks, such as if, while, and for, to implement control flow, whereas non-structured imperative languages use goto statements and branch tables for the same purpose.
Object-oriented programming
The focus of procedural programming is to break down a programming task into a collection of variables, data structures, and subroutines, whereas in object-oriented programming it is to break down a programming task into objects that expose behavior (methods) and data (members or attributes) using interfaces. The most important distinction is that while procedural programming uses procedures to operate on data structures, object-oriented programming bundles the two together, so an "object", which is an instance of a class, operates on its "own" data structure.[2]
Nomenclature varies between the two, although they have similar semantics:
Procedural	Object-oriented
Procedure	Method

Record
Object
Module	Class
Procedure call	Message
Functional programming
The principles of modularity and code reuse in practical functional languages are fundamentally the same as in procedural languages, since they both stem from structured programming. So for example:
Procedures correspond to functions. Both allow the reuse of the same code in various parts of the programs, and at various points of its execution.
By the same token, procedure calls correspond to function application.
Functions and their invocations are modularly separated from each other in the same manner, by the use of function arguments, return values and variable scopes.
The main difference between the styles is that functional programming languages remove or at least deemphasize the imperative elements of procedural programming. The feature set of functional languages is therefore designed to support writing programs as much as possible in terms of pure functions:
Whereas procedural languages model execution of the program as a sequence of imperative commands that may implicitly alter shared state, functional programming languages model execution as the evaluation of complex expressions that only depend on each other in terms of arguments and return values. For this reason, functional programs can have a free order of code execution, and the languages may offer little control over the order in which various parts of the program are executed. (For example, the arguments to a procedure invocation in Scheme are executed in an arbitrary order.)
Functional programming languages support (and heavily use) first-class functions, anonymous functions and closures, although these concepts are being included in newer procedural languages.
Functional programming languages tend to rely on tail call optimization and higher-order functions instead of imperative looping constructs.

Many functional languages, however, are in fact impurely functional and offer imperative/procedural constructs that allow the programmer to write programs in procedural style, or in a combination of both styles. It is common for input/output code in functional languages to be written in a procedural style.
There do exist a few esoteric functional languages (like Unlambda) that eschew structured programming precepts for the sake of being difficult to program in (and therefore challenging). These languages are the exception to the common ground between procedural and functional languages.
Logic programming
In logic programming, a program is a set of premises, and computation is performed by attempting to prove candidate theorems. From this point of view, logic programs are declarative, focusing on what the problem is, rather than on how to solve it.
However, the backward reasoning technique, implemented by SLD resolution, used to solve problems in logic programming languages such as Prolog, treats programs as goal-reduction procedures. Thus clauses of the form:
H :- B1, …, Bn.
have a dual interpretation, both as procedures
to show/solve H, show/solve B1 and … and Bn
and as logical implications:
B1 and … and Bn implies H.
Experienced logic programmers use the procedural interpretation to write programs that are effective and efficient, and they use the declarative interpretation to help ensure that programs are correct.

OOD - Nesne Yönelimli Tasarım               (GITHUB)  (test) 
Ood nedir, oop nedir
 
What does Object-Oriented Design (OOD) mean?
Object-oriented design (OOD) is the process of using an object-oriented methodology to design a computing system or application. This technique enables the implementation of a software solution based on the concepts of objects.
OOD serves as part of the object-oriented programming (OOP) process or lifecycle.
Techopedia explains Object-Oriented Design (OOD)
In object-oriented system design and development, OOD helps in designing the system architecture or layout - usually after completion of an object-oriented analysis (OOA). The designed system is later created or programmed using object-oriented based techniques and/or an object-oriented programming language (OOPL).
The OOD process takes the conceptual systems model, use cases, system relational model, user interface (UI) and other analysis data as input from the OOA phase. This is used in OOD to identify, define and design systems classes and objects, as well as their relationship, interface and implementation.-

"You aren't gonna need it" (YAGNI)              (GITHUB)  (test) 
Yagni nedir, YAGNI nedir
"You aren't gonna need it" (YAGNI) is a principle of extreme programming (XP) that states a programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary. XP co-founder Ron Jeffries has written: "Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them."[5] Other forms of the phrase include "You aren't going to need it" and "You ain't gonna need it".
YAGNI is a principle behind the XP practice of "do the simplest thing that could possibly work" (DTSTTCPW).[2][3] It is meant to be used in combination with several other practices, such as continuous refactoring, continuous automated unit testing, and continuous integration. Used without continuous refactoring, it could lead to disorganized code and massive rework, known as technical debt.[citation needed] YAGNI's dependency on supporting practices is part of the original definition of XP.

Garbage collection              (GITHUB)  (test) 
Garbage collection nedir
In computer science, garbage collection (GC) is a form of automatic memory management. The garbage collector, or just collector, attempts to reclaim garbage, or memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use by the program.
Garbage collection is essentially the opposite of manual memory management, which requires the programmer to specify which objects to deallocate and return to the memory system. However, many systems use a combination of approaches, including other techniques such as stack allocation and region inference. Like other memory management techniques, garbage collection may take a significant proportion of total processing time in a program and, as a result, can have significant influence on performance.

Automatic memory management is made possible by Garbage Collection in .NET Framework. When a class object is created at runtime, certain memory space is allocated to it in the heap memory. However, after all the actions related to the object are completed in the program, the memory space allocated to it is a waste as it cannot be used. In this case, garbage collection is very useful as it automatically releases the memory space after it is no longer required.
Garbage collection will always work on Managed Heap and internally it has an Engine which is known as the Optimization Engine.
Garbage Collection occurs if at least one of multiple conditions is satisfied. These conditions are given as follows:
•  If the system has low physical memory, then garbage collection is necessary.
•  If the memory allocated to various objects in the heap memory exceeds a pre-set threshold, then garbage collection occurs.
•  If the GC.Collect method is called, then garbage collection occurs. However, this method is only called under unusual situations as normally garbage collector runs automatically.
 
Marking Phase: A list of all the live objects is created during the marking phase. This is done by following the references from all the root objects. All of the objects that are not on the list of live objects are potentially deleted from the heap memory.
Relocating Phase: The references of all the objects that were on the list of all the live objects are updated in the relocating phase so that they point to the new location where the objects will be relocated to in the compacting phase.
Compacting Phase: The heap gets compacted in the compacting phase as the space occupied by the dead objects is released and the live objects remaining are moved. All the live objects that remain after the garbage collection are moved towards the older end of the heap memory in their original order.

C/C++/Pascal gibi dillerle yazılan uygulamalar direkt olarak makine koduna dönüştürülerek çalıştırılır. .NET, Java, Python gibi dillerde yazılan uygulamalar ise bir runtime tarafından çalıştırılırlar. runtime'a sahip olmanın en önemli avantajlarından biri uygulamanın hafıza yönetimini runtime'ın otomatik olarak yapmasıdır. runtime uygulamanın hafıza isteklerini işletim sisteminden önceden aldığı hafıza alanından karşılar, uygulamanın hafıza alanı ile işi bittiğinde ise geri alır. Hafızanın geri alınması görevini Garbage Collector - GC yapar.
GC otomatik hafıza yönetimi ile uygulama yazımını kolaylaştırmakta, kodlama süresini kısaltmaktadır. Yine GC, makine koduna derlenen dillere göre kodlama hatalarından dolayı karşılaşılan hafıza alanlarının leak edilmesi problemi ile de bir seviyeye kadar baş edebilmektedir.
GC çalıştığında uygulamada artık referans edilmeyen objeleri temizler, hafıza fragmantasyonunu engellemek için de temizlikle boşalan alanları hala kullanılmakta olan objeleri taşımak suretiyle birleştirir.

Coder vs Developer              (GITHUB)  (test) 
Coder nedir, developer nedir
Anyone who can write some code is often referred to as a coder by the people outside of the tech industry. But, usually, coders are considered the least trained or experienced level of programmers. These individuals do not have the same algorithmic knowledge as a programmer or developer, as they are often a beginner in the field, skilled in just one coding language. Coders are usually given the job of writing forthright pieces of code that can easily be delegated by the developers. As some are put-off by the title, it is sometimes used interchangeably with “Junior Programmer” or “Junior Developer.”

Web Service              (GITHUB)  (test) 
[Web service nedir, web services nedir]
Web servis, elektronik cihaz tarafından başka bir elektronik cihaza sunulan, World Wide Web üzerinden birbirleriyle iletişim kuran yapıların bütününe verilen isimdir. Bir Web servisinde, HTTP gibi bir Web teknolojisi orijinal olarak insandan makineye iletişim için tasarlanmıştır. HTML, XML, JSON gibi makine tarafından okunabilen dosya formatlarını aktarmak için kullanılır.
AJAX (Eşzamansız Javascript ve XML), Web servislerinde yaygın olarak kullanılan bir tekniktir. AJAX, sahne arkasındaki bir web sunucusuyla veri alışverişi yaparak web sayfalarının eşzamansız olarak güncellenmesini sağlar. Böylece, bir web sayfasının bölümlerini tüm sayfayı yeniden yüklemeden güncelleyebilir. AJAX ismi bazı insanlar için yanıltıcıdır. AJAX uygulamaları verileri taşımak için XML kullanabilir, ancak verileri JSON metni olarak taşımak XML'e kıyasla daha yaygındır.

Different books and different organizations provide different definitions to Web Services. Some of them are listed here.
•	A web service is any piece of software that makes itself available over the internet and uses a standardized XML messaging system. XML is used to encode all communications to a web service. For example, a client invokes a web service by sending an XML message, then waits for a corresponding XML response. As all communication is in XML, web services are not tied to any one operating system or programming language—Java can talk with Perl; Windows applications can talk with Unix applications.
•	Web services are self-contained, modular, distributed, dynamic applications that can be described, published, located, or invoked over the network to create products, processes, and supply chains. These applications can be local, distributed, or web-based. Web services are built on top of open standards such as TCP/IP, HTTP, Java, HTML, and XML.
•	Web services are XML-based information exchange systems that use the Internet for direct application-to-application interaction. These systems can include programs, objects, messages, or documents.
•	A web service is a collection of open protocols and standards used for exchanging data between applications or systems. Software applications written in various programming languages and running on various platforms can use web services to exchange data over computer networks like the Internet in a manner similar to inter-process communication on a single computer. This interoperability (e.g., between Java and Python, or Windows and Linux applications) is due to the use of open standards.
To summarize, a complete web service is, therefore, any service that −
•	Is available over the Internet or private (intranet) networks
•	Uses a standardized XML messaging system
•	Is not tied to any one operating system or programming language
•	Is self-describing via a common XML grammar
•	Is discoverable via a simple find mechanism
Components of Web Services
The basic web services platform is XML + HTTP. All the standard web services work using the following components −
•	SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
•	UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery and Integration)
•	WSDL (Web Services Description Language)
All these components have been discussed in the Web Services Architecture chapter.
How Does a Web Service Work?
A web service enables communication among various applications by using open standards such as HTML, XML, WSDL, and SOAP. A web service takes the help of −
•	XML to tag the data
•	SOAP to transfer a message
•	WSDL to describe the availability of service.
You can build a Java-based web service on Solaris that is accessible from your Visual Basic program that runs on Windows.
You can also use C# to build new web services on Windows that can be invoked from your web application that is based on JavaServer Pages (JSP) and runs on Linux.
Example
Consider a simple account-management and order processing system. The accounting personnel use a client application built with Visual Basic or JSP to create new accounts and enter new customer orders.
The processing logic for this system is written in Java and resides on a Solaris machine, which also interacts with a database to store information.
The steps to perform this operation are as follows −
•	The client program bundles the account registration information into a SOAP message.
•	This SOAP message is sent to the web service as the body of an HTTP POST request.
•	The web service unpacks the SOAP request and converts it into a command that the application can understand.
•	The application processes the information as required and responds with a new unique account number for that customer.
•	Next, the web service packages the response into another SOAP message, which it sends back to the client program in response to its HTTP request.
•	The client program unpacks the SOAP message to obtain the results of the account registration process.

Implicit	      (GITHUB)  (test) 
Implicit nedir, implicit nedir, explicit nedir
(Implicit: dolaylı yoldan, yani direkt olarak DEĞİL / suggested, not directly expressed.)
(explicit: stated clearly and in detail, leaving no room for confusion or doubt.)
Java üzerinden açıklamış, güzel: 
Explicit means done by the programmer. Implicit means done by the JVM or the tool , not the Programmer.
For Example: Java will provide us default constructor implicitly.Even if the programmer didn't write code for constructor, he can call default constructor.
Explicit is opposite to this , ie. programmer has to write.

Önemli:
Why public variables are not allowed inside a method or any block except class in c#? 
(field nedir, local variable nedir)
Answer:
There is a difference between variables and fields. Only fields have access protection, while variables cannot be accessed at all outside method's body.
"Public variables" in C# are called fields. C# allows field declarations to appear only in the body of a class or a struct. Fields are parts of an object definition, which are either attached to an instance, or shared among all instances.
Variables inside methods, on the other hand, are not fields. Being local to a method body, they do not need access protection. Their lifetime and scope are limited inside the method, so there is no way for any code outside of that method to access local variables.

Another Answer:

Inside a method any variable you declare is only accessible within the method, it is called a local variable. Access modifiers (public, private etc.) make no sense here, as the variable won't exist outside the scope of the method.

If you want a method to set up your public variable for access elsewhere, you can assign values to it, but you can't declare a public variable in your method.
-
You cannot define a public element inside a method. This element exists while the method is executing and cannot be accessed outside this main method.
-
Fields within a method are local to the method and are therefore don't have access modifiers.
Access modifiers are applied at the class level i.e.
public class Person {

  private String name

  public String getName() {
    return this.name
  }
}
-
Local variable can not be public. public, private, proctacted are only used with class level members.
Assume that if it is possible to do so then also how can you access it out of the method or class. So specifing scope before locel members is dose not make any sense.
-
Variables declared in methods (aka local variables) are only accessible within the method. After the method returns, all local variables in the method became unaccessible. You can treat all the local variables as if they were private.
Why is it so then?
Local variables' purpose is to temporarily store data during the execution of a method. As we all know, a method either does something, or return something, or both. While a method is doing this business, objects might be created to help with whatever the method is doing. And the objects are stored in variables. Since these variables only help the method do its job, they are not needed after the method finishes its job (returns).
See? They are temporary. There is no point accessing them from another scope.

C# - Static Class, Methods, Constructors, Fields	      (GITHUB)  (test) 
Static nedir
In C#, static means something which cannot be instantiated. You cannot create an object of a static class and cannot access static members using an object.
C# classes, variables, methods, properties, operators, events, and constructors can be defined as static using the static modifier keyword.
Static Class
Apply the static modifier before the class name and after the access modifier to make a class static. The following defines a static class with static fields and methods.
Example: C# Static Class
public static class Calculator
{
    private static int _resultStorage = 0;
    
    public static string Type = "Arithmetic";

    public static int Sum(int num1, int num2)
    {
        return num1 + num2;
    }

    public static void Store(int result)
    {
        _resultStorage = result;
    }
}
Above, the Calculator class is a static. All the members of it are also static.
You cannot create an object of the static class; therefore the members of the static class can be accessed directly using a class name like ClassName.MemberName, as shown below.
Example: Accessing Static Members
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var result = Calculator.Sum(10, 25); // calling static method
        Calculator.Store(result); 

        var calcType = Calculator.Type; // accessing static variable
        Calculator.Type = "Scientific"; // assign value to static variable
    }
}
Try it
Rules for Static Class
1.	Static classes cannot be instantiated.
2.	All the members of a static class must be static; otherwise the compiler will give an error.
3.	A static class can contain static variables, static methods, static properties, static operators, static events, and static constructors.
4.	A static class cannot contain instance members and constructors.
5.	Indexers and destructors cannot be static
6.	var cannot be used to define static members. You must specify a type of member explicitly after the static keyword.
7.	Static classes are sealed class and therefore, cannot be inherited.
8.	A static class cannot inherit from other classes.
9.	Static class members can be accessed using ClassName.MemberName.
10.	A static class remains in memory for the lifetime of the application domain in which your program resides.
Static Members in Non-static Class
The normal class (non-static class) can contain one or more static methods, fields, properties, events and other non-static members.
It is more practical to define a non-static class with some static members, than to declare an entire class as static.
Static Fields
Static fields in a non-static class can be defined using the static keyword.
Static fields of a non-static class is shared across all the instances. So, changes done by one instance would reflect in others.
Example: Shared Static Fields
public class StopWatch
{
    public static int InstanceCounter = 0;
    // instance constructor
    public StopWatch()
    {
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        StopWatch sw1 = new StopWatch();
        StopWatch sw2 = new StopWatch();
        Console.WriteLine(StopWatch.NoOfInstances); //2 
			
        StopWatch sw3 = new StopWatch();
        StopWatch sw4 = new StopWatch();
        Console.WriteLine(StopWatch.NoOfInstances);//4
    }
}
Try it
Static Methods
You can define one or more static methods in a non-static class. Static methods can be called without creating an object. You cannot call static methods using an object of the non-static class.
The static methods can only call other static methods and access static members. You cannot access non-static members of the class in the static methods.
Example: Static Method
class Program
{
    static int counter = 0;
    string name = "Demo Program";

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        counter++; // can access static fields
        Display("Hello World!"); // can call static methods

        name = "New Demo Program"; //Error: cannot access non-static members
        SetRootFolder("C:\MyProgram"); //Error: cannot call non-static method
    }

    static void Display(string text)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(text);
    }

    public void SetRootFolder(string path) {  }
}
Rules for Static Methods
1.	Static methods can be defined using the static keyword before a return type and after an access modifier.
2.	Static methods can be overloaded but cannot be overridden.
3.	Static methods can contain local static variables.
4.	Static methods cannot access or call non-static variables unless they are explicitly passed as parameters.
Static Constructors
A non-static class can contain a parameterless static constructor. It can be defined with the static keyword and without access modifiers like public, private, and protected.
The following example demonstrates the difference between static constructor and instance constructor. (Aşağıdaki örnek çok faydalı, -- static constructor nedir)
Example: Static Constructor vs Instance Constructor
public class StopWatch
{
    // static constructor
    static StopWatch()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Static constructor called");
    }

    // instance constructor
    public StopWatch()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Instance constructor called");
    }

    // static method
    public static void DisplayInfo()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("DisplayInfo called");
    }

    // instance method
    public void Start() { }

    // instance method
    public void Stop() {  }
}
Try it
Above, the non-static class StopWatch contains a static constructor and also a non-static constructor.
The static constructor is called only once whenever the static method is used or creating an instance for the first time. The following example shows that the static constructor gets called when the static method called for the first time. Calling the static method second time onwards won't call a static constructor.
Example: Static Constructor Execution
StopWatch.DisplayInfo(); // static constructor called here
StopWatch.DisplayInfo(); // none of the constructors called here
Output:
Static constructor called.
DisplayInfo called
DisplayInfo called
The following example shows that the static constructor gets called when you create an instance for the first time.
Example: Static Constructor Execution
StopWatch sw1 = new StopWatch(); // First static constructor and then instance constructor called 
StopWatch sw2 = new StopWatch();// only instance constructor called 
StopWatch.DisplayInfo();
Output:
Static constructor called
instance constructor called
instance constructor called
DisplayInfo called
Rules for Static Constructors
1.	The static constructor is defined using the static keyword and without using access modifiers public, private, or protected.
2.	A non-static class can contain one parameterless static constructor. Parameterized static constructors are not allowed.
3.	Static constructor will be executed only once in the lifetime. So, you cannot determine when it will get called in an application if a class is being used at multiple places.
4.	A static constructor can only access static members. It cannot contain or access instance members.

Scope, Local Variable	      (GITHUB)  (test) 
Scope nedir, local nedir, local variable nedir
When a variable is declared in a method of a C# program, its scope is pre-defined and its visibility is defined for the rest of the program. When it's created this way, the variable will be available as long as its method is in execution. However, when the control is passed to another method, its scope ends. This type of variable is called a local variable.
In this guide, we will learn about the scope of local variables and combat the issues related to the position of variable declaration in C# code.
An example of a local variable:
using System;
public class NewProgram {
   public static void Main(string[] args) {
      int x;
      x = 10; // local variable
      Console.WriteLine("Value:" + x);
   }
}
csharp
Output will be:
1
Value:10
console
These variables can be used only within code blocks that are inside that function.
There are other ways to define and use a variable by declaring it in a class (or as a global variable), which allows it to be available to all methods in that class.
Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a class or namespace. C# does not directly support global variables, but the functionality of global variables can be achieved by creating a static class, which is helpful in specific cases. As a general practice, it's best to avoid using global variables because they violate the object-oriented programming philosophy of C# and can make things complicated while multi-threading, etc. Be cautious to avoid conflicts by adding locks or ensuring that only one thread has access to the global variable at any given instance.
The scope of a variable is within the full code block of its declaration. Also, since the code blocks are sometimes nested as per the application requirement, a loop defined within the method of a class gives three nested code blocks and subsequently three levels of nested-scope. If a variable is defined in any of these scopes, it will be visible to the current scope and the ones that are nested within it.
In simple terms:
•	A variable declared within a loop will not be visible outside the loop.
•	A variable that has been declared outside a loop will be accessible from inside the loop too.
Variable Scopes in C#
To understand the scope of a local variable well, it is important to understand the levels of scope in C# .
Class-Level Scope
Variables defined in the class are available to all non-static methods declared in the class, called fields or class members. Their access modifier does not affect their scope within the class, and they can be accessed outside of the class using access modifiers.

For example:
using System; 
class ClassScope { // class level scope starts here
    int abc = 1000; // class level variable with class level scope 
    public void display() { 
    	Console.WriteLine(a); // method to access the class level variable 
	} // method ends here
} // class level scope ends 
csharp
Method-Level Scope
Variables declared within a method are available to its corresponding parts and also the nested code blocks. They are not available outside the method. These are local variables. Variables cease to exist after method execution is complete.
static void Main(string[] args) {
    int marks;                                          // Declared at the method-level
    marks = 100;                                        // Used at the method-level
	if (marks >= 50)
    	Console.WriteLine("Great Marks are : {0}", marks);   // Used in the nested scope
	else
    	Console.WriteLine("Bad marks are : {0}", marks);   // Again, used in the nested scope
}
csharp
Output will be:
Great Marks are : 100
Nested Scope
We have explained earlier that variables declared in a nested scope will not be available outside their respective code blocks. These can be called loop variables. We will show in the following example that a variable declared in a nested scope of an if statement cannot be used at the method level and will not compile.
static void Main(string [] args){
    int score = 100;
    if (score >= 60)
        string message = "Good score";                  // Declared in if statement 
    else
    	string message = "Poor score";                  // Declared in else statement
    Console.WriteLine(message);                         // Variable unavailable
}
csharp
Output will be:
Error(s):
(15:9) Embedded statement cannot be a declaration or labeled statement
(17:6) Embedded statement cannot be a declaration or labeled statement
console

If we wanted to make this code work, we could declare the variable before the if statement and assign a value to it within the if statement.
*Note: There is a crucial difference in between the scope definition in C and C#.
If a C# variable is defined within the local scope in a block (if/else) which is conflicting with a variable defined outside following that block, it will give an error. A similar code is compiled under C/C++ or Java. Local variables will remain in scope throughout the entire block where they have been declared. This is the opposite of C++, where the local variables are in scope at points in their block only after they have been declared.
public void function(){
  if (true) {
    /* scope of local if */
    int a = 2;
    System.Console.WriteLine(a);
  } else {
    /* no conflict arises with same if/else */
    int a = 4;
    System.Console.WriteLine(a);
  }

  if (true) {
    /* no conflict with local from different if scope */
    int a = 10;
    System.Console.WriteLine(a);
  }
}
csharp
We know that while declaring a scope, any local variable from the outer scope is known. There is no possibility that a local variable within a scope would override the local variable from an outside scope.
Scopes and Related Error Messages
The general rules of thumb for C# are:
•	It is erroneous for a local variable declaration and nested local variable declaration space to contain elements of same name.
•	There will occur a compile time error if, within the scope of a local variable, it is in a textual position that occurs before the local-variable-declarator. If the local variable declaration is implicit, there will still be an error to refer to that variable in its local-variable-declarator.
These rules can be understood and remembered with a simple example.
class Clarity {
    public int time;

    void Function() {
        int seconds;
        seconds = 0; // (Line 1) Will bind to local variable defined above
        time = 0; // (Line 2) Binds to field time

        {
            seconds = "s"; // (Line 3) Will bind to local variable defined below
            string seconds;

            time = "s"; // (Line 4) Binds to local variable defined below.
            string time;
        }
    }
}
csharp
At line 2, one would think that seconds would bind to Clarity.seconds just as in line 1. However, the C# spec defines clearly that name will resolve to closest scope. At line 3 and line 4 there will be compiler errors.
However, a reference to the local variable inside the declarator is allowed, though it is not implicitly typed. So the following will be true:
int a = (x = 5); // Allowed
var b = (y = 10); // Will result in an error
csharp
In the first statement, we have already declared the type to be int. When the binding takes place, it is okay because the left side (variable initializer) is apt. Meanwhile, we did not have a type for b initially, so when the binding takes place, we are not certain if 10 can even be assigned to b or not.
One thing that can be done is name hiding. This is allowed only on fields that are not referenced in current scope. We are allowed to redefine a variable as a string because it has not been referenced yet in the scope for a given method.
We realize that this method of using a name before its declarator causes the compiler to generate errors, which is not ideal. In simple terms, the plain name is resolved to whatever statement is declared inside its current block, regardless of whether there exists a same name variable or definition outside the block.
Also, in the 2005 C# Compiler, we incorrectly bound both statements of s to outer local variable, and line 1 would bind perfectly. But there was an error on line 2 reporting that the string is not convertible to int. There was also an error on line 3 that you cannot redeclare s to something else.
Then, in the 2008 C# Compiler, this was fixed to correctly reflect the spec. Both line 1 and line 2 would bind to line 3. Since they were textually before their declaration, both would yield an error, saying that they were being used before being declared. Line 3 also gives an error that you cannot redeclare s.
Conclusion
This guide has explained the scope of local variables in C#. Armed with this knowledge, we can avoid common binding issues and errors and define variables in the correct scope. If an unknown error or garbage value occurs within variables, it can be resolved by assigning values once the scope is well known.
Happy learning C#!

Definition - What does Local Variable mean?
A local variable, in C#, is a type of variable declared by local variable declaration at the beginning of a block the variable is intended to be local to. It can also occur in a for-statement, a switch-statement, a foreach statement, a using statement or a specific-catch statement or using statement.

The local variable declaration explicitly defines the type of the variable that has been declared along with the identifier that names the variable.

A local variable is a type of variable that can be used where the scope and extent of the variable is within the method or statement block in which it is declared. It is used as an iteration variable in the foreach statement, exception variable in the specific-catch clause and resource variable in the using statement. It can also be used as a constant whose value cannot be modified within the method or statement block in which it is declared.

An implicitly typed local variable whose type is inferred by the compiler from the expression on its right is useful in dealing with language integrated queries (LINQ), which return anonymous types in creating a custom type for each LINQ result set.
Techopedia explains Local Variable
The memory allocation of a local variable is based on its type. In case of a value-typed local variable (of types like struct, integer, etc.), the entire contents are stored in the stack, whereas the reference typed variable is stored such that its reference portion is in the stack and its contents are in the heap.

An implicitly typed local variable is declared without using .NET type, but with the keyword "var," which assigns the appropriate type. For example, an implicitly typed local variable can be used in a "foreach" statement without declaring its type to iterate a collection.

A local variable should not be referred in the code in a textual position that precedes the declaration statement of that local variable. In addition, there cannot be two or more local variables with the same name within a single block, as this can result in compilation error. Multiple local variables of the same type can be declared and initialized in a single statement.

Within a method of a class that has a local variable named similar to its field, the local variable hides the field while accessing it within the method. It is more efficient to use a local variable than a field.
This definition was written in the context of C#

Declaration nedir
This is when you state to the program that there will be an object of a certain type existing and what the name of that object will be.
Deklare: olayı DEKLARE ETME anlamına gelir. Yani programa DEKLERE EDİYOZ bir şey yapacağımızı. Yani ilerde sana ihtiyacımız olabilir diyoruz. Yani hafızaya ihtiyacımız olabilir
Declare means to tell the compiler that something exists, so that space may be allocated for it. This is separate from defining or initializing something in that it does not necessarily say what "value" the thing has, only that it exists. In C/C++ there is a strong distinction between declaring and defining. In C# there is much less of a distinction, though the terms can still be used similarly.
Instantiate literally means "to create an instance of". In programming, this generally means to create an instance of an object (generally on "the heap"). This is done via the new keyword in most languages. ie: new object();. Most of the time you will also save a reference to the object. ie: object myObject = new object();.
Initialize means to give an initial value to. In some languages, if you don't initialize a variable it will have arbitrary (dirty/garbage) data in it. In C# it is actually a compile-time error to read from an uninitialized variable.
Assigning is simply the storing of one value to a variable. x = 5 assigns the value 5 to the variable x. In some languages, assignment cannot be combined with declaration, but in C# it can be: int x = 5;.

Impli  int i = 100;   // explicitly typed 
            var i = 100;    // implicityly type

Data Types in C# (Reference Type, Value Type) 	      (GITHUB)  (test)
Data type nedir, data types nedir, ref type nedir, reference type nedir, value types nedir, value type nedir
Önemli: https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/csharp/csharp-data-types
The following data types are all of value type:
•	bool
•	byte
•	char
•	decimal
•	double
•	enum
•	float
•	int
•	long
•	sbyte
•	short
•	struct
•	uint
•	ulong
•	ushort
C# mainly categorized data types in two types: Value types and Reference types. Value types include simple types (e.g. int, float, bool, and char), enum types, struct types, and Nullable value types. 
Reference types include class types, interface types, delegate types, and array types. 
Learn about value types and reference types in detail in the next chapter.
 
Reference Types:
Reference types have null value by default, when they are not initialized.
For example, a string variable (or any other variable of reference type datatype) without a value assigned to it. In this case, it has a null value, meaning it doesn't point to any other memory location, because it has no value yet.
A value type variable cannot be null because it holds a value not a memory address. However, value type variables must be assigned some value before use. 
The compiler will give an error if you try to use a local value type variable without assigning a value to it.
However, value type field in a class can be declared without initialization (field not a local variable in the function). (class dışında da declare edebiliyoruz zaten) It will have a default value if not assigned any value, e.g., int will have 0, boolean will have false and so on.
class myClass
{
    public int i;
}

myClass mcls = new myClass();

Console.WriteLine(mcls.i); 
 
Output: 0

Points to Remember :
1.	Value type stores the value in its memory space, whereas reference type stores the address of the value where it is stored.
2.	Primitive data types and struct are of the 'Value' type. Class objects, string, array, delegates are reference types.
3.	Value type passes byval by default. Reference type passes byref by default.
4.	Value types and reference types stored in Stack and Heap in the memory depends on the scope of the variable.

Reference Data Types : The Reference Data Types will contain a memory address of variable value because the reference types won’t store the variable value directly in memory. The built-in reference types are string, object.
•	String : It represents a sequence of Unicode characters and its type name is System.String. So, string and String are equivalent.
Example:
•	string s1 = "hello"; // creating through string keyword  
•	String s2 = "welcome"; // creating through String class  
•	Object : In C#, all types, predefined and user-defined, reference types and value types, inherit directly or indirectly from Object. So basically it is the base class for all the data types in C#. Before assigning values, it needs type conversion. When a variable of a value type is converted to object, it’s called boxing. When a variable of type object is converted to a value type, it’s called unboxing. Its type name is System.Object.

Class’lar referans tiptedirler.

        public class Book
        {
           public List<int> theList = new List<int>();
        }

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Book book1 = new Book();
            book1.theList.Add(20);
            book1.theList.Add(21);

            Book book2 = book1;
            book2.theList.Add(51);

            foreach(var item in book2.theList)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(item); //sonuç: 20,21,51
                //Çünkü book2 ile yeni bir obje oluşturmadık. Ram'de aynı noktaya işaret ediyorlar. Dikkat edilirse book2 oluştururken new keyword'ü de kullanılmadı.
            }
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
Resimlerde görüldüğü gibi, book1 i instantiate ettik. Sonra book2 yi book1’e eşitledik. Bu durumda iki tane obje oluşturulmuş olmadı. İki tane pointer (book1 ve book2) tek bir objeye işaret ediyor oldu. Yani iki isimden de (book1,book2) tek bir objeye ulaşıyoruz, yani iki değişken ile aslında tek bir RAM lokasyonuna ulaşıyoruz. (dikkat edilirse new keyword’ü falan kullanmadık)
Zaten dikkat edilirse, book2 yi oluştururken bir initialization yapmıyoruz. New keword’ünü kullanmıyoruz. Bu bize yeni bir obje oluşturmadığımız konusunda kolayca ipucu verir.

Immutability / Immutable Value Types	      (GITHUB)  (test)
Immutability nedir, immutability nedir, immutable nedir
An object is immutable if its state doesn’t change once the object has been created.
Defining a type as a value type, indicates that the runtime will copy the values instead of a reference to the runtime. Mutability, on the other hand, depends on the implementation, and each class can implement it as it wants.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/868411/are-value-types-immutable-by-definition

Are value types immutable by definition?
No, they are not immutable by definition, it depends on the case if they should be mutable or not. For instance, if they should serve as dictionary keys, they should be immutable.
Diğer cevap:
Short answer: No, value types are not immutable by definition. Both structs and classes can be either mutable or immutable. All four combinations are possible. If a struct or class has non-readonly public fields, public properties with setters, or methods which set private fields, it is mutable because you can change its state without creating a new instance of that type.
Long answer: First of all, the question of immutability only applies to structs or classes with fields or properties. The most basic types (numbers, strings, and null) are inherently immutable because there is nothing (field/property) to change about them. A 5 is a 5 is a 5. Any operation on the 5 only returns another immutable value.

Value Type’lar Immutable’dır. Yani hiçbir şekilde değiştirilemezler. Yani örneğin integer’in 4 değeri her zaman 4’e karşılık gelir. Değiştirilemez. 
Variable’ların value’larından bahsetmiyoruz. Bahsedilen value, Value Type’in value’sudur.

If you take your logic far enough, then all types are immutable. When you modify a reference type, you could argue that you're really writing a new object to the same address, rather than modifying anything.
Or you could argue that everything is mutable, in any language, because occasionally memory that had previously been used for one thing, will be overwritten by another.
With enough abstractions, and ignoring enough language features, you can get to any conclusion you like.
And that misses the point. According to .NET spec, value types are mutable. You can modify it.
int i = 0;
Console.WriteLine(i); // will print 0, so here, i is 0
++i;
Console.WriteLine(i); // will print 1, so here, i is 1
but it is still the same i. The variable i is only declared once. Anything that happens to it after this declaration is a modification.
In something like a functional language with immutable variables, this would not be legal. The ++i would not be possible. Once a variable has been declared, it has a fixed value.
In .NET, that is not the case, there is nothing to stop me from modifying the i after it's been declared.
After thinking about it a bit more, here's another example that might be better:
struct S {
  public S(int i) { this.i = i == 43 ? 0 : i; }
  private int i;
  public void set(int i) { 
    Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
    this.i = i;
  }
}

void Foo {
  var s = new S(42); // Create an instance of S, internally storing the value 42
  s.set(43); // What happens here?
}
On the last line, according to your logic, we could say that we actually construct a new object, and overwrite the old one with that value. But that's not possible! To construct a new object, the compiler has to set the i variable to 42. But it's private! It is only accessible through a user-defined constructor, which explicitly disallows the value 43 (setting it to 0 instead), and then through our set method, which has a nasty side-effect. The compiler has no way of just creating a new object with the values it likes. The only way in which s.i can be set to 43 is by modifying the current object by calling set(). The compiler can't just do that, because it would change the behavior of the program (it would print to the console)
So for all structs to be immutable, the compiler would have to cheat and break the rules of the language. And of course, if we're willing to break the rules, we can prove anything. I could prove that all integers are equal too, or that defining a new class will cause your computer to catch fire. As long as we stay within the rules of the language, structs are mutable.

Değeri değiştirilemez olan: value type’lardır. Hiçbir şekilde değerleri değiştirilemez. Örneği inceleyiniz:

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            DateTime datetime1 = new DateTime(2019, 6, 24);

            datetime1.AddDays(1); // burada kullandığımız Addays metodu, datetime1 değişkeninin değerini değiştirmeyecektir. Bunun yerine; yeni bir Datetime instance'ı oluşturacaktır ve onun değerini değiştirecektir.

            string string1;

            string1 = " Hello. How'z it going? ";

            string1.Trim(); // Bu da aynı şekilde, değeri değiştirmeyecektir; yeni bir string değişkeni initialize edip, bu değişken için Trim fonksiyonunu çalıştırıp çıkan sonucu return edecektir. Yani string1’in value’sini değiştirmeyecektir.

            // Bu iki örnekteki sonuçların sebebi şudur: Value Type'lar genellikle immutable'dır. Yani immutable olan bir Value Type'dan bir değişken initialize etmişsek, artık onun değerini değiştiremeyiz. Internal veya external hiçbir şekilde değerini değiştirmemizin imkanı yoktur.
            // Bu immutable Value Type'ların bazı örnekleri Datetime ve String'dir. Bu sebeple de yukarıdaki örneklerin sonucu anlatıldığı gibi olmuştur.

            //Not: String'ler referance type olmasına rağmen birçok yönden value type'mış gibi davranır. String, char dizilerinin adresini tutar ve yeni bir metoda bu değişken yollandığı zaman; yeni bir değişken initialize edilip char dizisi bu değişkene yollanır. Ama burada yapılan bir kopyalama işlemi değildir. String değişkeninin adresi alınıp diğer değişkene atanır. Böylelikle yeni değişken de aynı char dizisine sahip olur. Burada 'kopyalama' yapılmamasının sebebi performanstır. String'in işaret ettiği milyonlarca char olabilir. Şu durumda bir değişken içindeki milyonlarca char'ın kopyalanacağına, adresinin yollanması çok daha verimli olacaktır.

            //Şöyle bir eşitlikle işlemi başarabiliriz:

            string1 = string1.ToUpper(); //İşlem başarılı. Sonuç: "Hello. How'z it going?"

   Student s1 = new Student();
            Student s2 = s1;

            s1.Name = "First";

            Console.WriteLine(s1.Name); // First
            Console.WriteLine(s2.Name); // First

            s1 = new Student(); //yeni bir initialization yaptık. [bkz Student();] Kısaca burada yeni bir şeyler oluyor.. Constructor metodu vb çalışıyor.. Olan şey şu; yeni bir obje oluşturuyoruz.
            // O halde s1 ile s2 artık RAM'de aynı yere işaret edebilir mi? Edemez. Çünkü s2 artık ESKİ objeye (s1) işaret ediyor. Fakat biz bu satırda yeni bir s1 objesi initialize ettik. Yani artık bu ikisi RAM'da aynı lokasyona bakmıyor. Görelim:
            s1.Name = "Second";

            Console.WriteLine(s1.Name); // Second
            Console.WriteLine(s2.Name); // First

            Console.ReadKey();
            Console.ReadKey();
        }

In English Language Mutable means "can change" and immutable means "cannot change". The term Immutable Object means that the state of the Object cannot change after its creation. An immutable type sets the property or state of the object as read only because it cannot be modified after it is assigned during initialization.
Is String in .Net immutable?
Yes, the String in .Net is immutable. The System.String class is an immutable type provided in the .NET framework class library. Since a String is an immutable type, it cannot be modified. When you modify a string you are actually creating a new string object with the desired value.
e.g.
 
The above code will create 1000 new string variables in the memory.

Immutability of strings has positive significance in multithreaded applications because it provides automatic thread safety. Instances of immutable types are inherently thread-safe, because no thread can modify it.
The main drawback of immutable types is that they require more resources than other object types. Because each time it modified, it creates a new one.
The above code segment creates 1000 new string variables. In these type of situations you should use the StringBuilder class, which allows you to modify the text without making new String class instances. StringBuilder is a Mutable type, that means when you alter it , it still holding same data.

String bir value type gibi görünür:
String s1 = "Hello";
s1.Trim();

Evet, yukarıdaki Trim metodu s1 değişkeninin değerini değiştiremez. Halbuki değiştirmesi gerekiyordu? Değil mi? Neden, çünkü string’e bir ref type dedik.. 

String’ler ref type olabilirler evet, ama value type gibi davranırlar. O yüzden bu örnekteki Trim metodu asıl değerimizi değiştirmeyecek, kendi kendine farklı bir değişken yaratıp değerini ona atayacak, bizim asıl s1’imize atamayacak. 
Trim bir değişken return edecek. Bu değişkeni havada kapmalıyız, şöyle ki:

String s2 = s1.Trim();

Return edilmiş değeri s2 diye bir değişkene attık ve işlemi tamamladık.

String’in bir reference type olduğunu hangi mantık yoluyla hatırlayabiliriz? Bence şöyle hatırlanabilir: String değişkeni çok büyük değerler tutabilir içinde. Aşsdkasidkasdşlaksdşaiskd gibi bir değer veya çok daha uzun bir string değeri tutabilir. Şu durumda çok büyük bir Ram lokasyonu ayırmak gerekir; o halde her string değişkeni için kocaman RAM lokasyonu ayırmamız gerekmez miydi, çünkü çok büyük string’ler de gelebilir bu değişkene (sadklşasdlasdşklas örneği gibi).

            Console.WriteLine(str10); //String Ten

            //Görüldüğü üzere ToUpper metodunda oluşan değer bizim değişkenimiz üzerine kaydedilmedi. Neden?
            //Çünkü string = Reference Type olduğu halde bir Value Type'mış gibi davranır ve RAM üzerinde ADRESLEME değil KOPYALAMA yapar.
            //Yani toUpper metodu yeni bir string değişkeni yarattı (string'in yeni bir instance'ını oluşturdu ve bu instance'ı dönderdi: dolayısıyla RAM'da farklı bir lokasyonda bulunuyor) ve bunun değerini "STRING TEN" olarak belirledi.
            //Ama bu işlem bizim str10 değişkenimiz üzerinde bir değişime sebep olmadı. Çünkü onun RAM'deki lokasyonu farklı.

            //O halde; ToUpper metodundan çıkan sonucu kullanmak istiyorsak; yeni bir değişken oluşturup sonucu buna yazdırmamız gerekir:

            string str20 = str10.ToUpper();

            Console.WriteLine(str20); //STRING TEN

            //Sonuç: String sanıldığı gibi bir VALUE TYPE değildir. REFERENCE TYPE'dır ama VALUE TYPE gibi davranır.

Foreign Key	   (GITHUB)  (test)
Foreign key nedir
Gereksiz query yazmamamızı sağlar diyor Mosh Hamedani. True.
The ForeignKey attribute is used to configure a foreign key in the relationship between two entities in EF 6 and EF Core. It overrides the default conventions. As per the default convention, EF makes a property as foreign key property when its name matches with the primary key property of a related entity.

Kısayollar / Keyboard Shortcuts	(GITHUB) (asasas)
Kısayol nedir, shortcut nedir

Chrome offers “F5” key and the “Ctrl+R” key combination are used to reload the currently open Web page. Chrome also offers the reload shortcut combinations of “Ctrl + F5” and “Ctrl + Shift + R” to reload the currently open page and override the locally cached version.

-Home, end (numpad’dakiler) : satırın başına ve sonuna gider. (shift ile de kullanılır, yazıyı seçmek için...)

-Klavyenin üstündeki home end tuşları: sayfanın başına ve sonuna gider.

-Numpad’daki home end tuşları ctrl ile kullanıldığında, tıpkı klavyenin üstündeki home-end tuşları gibi çalışıyor. Yani klavyenin üstündeki home-end tuşlarını kullanmaya gerek yok gibi görünüyor.

-Ctrl – yön tuşları  kelimenin başına sonuna gidiyor atlayarak.

-Next Error (F2)

-Previous error (Shift + F2)

-Expand Selection (Ctrl + W)

-Ctrl + n  create new file

- alt + yukarı aşağı arrows  iki satırın yerini birbiri arasında değiştirme.

-shift + alt -> kare alan seçme (çoklu satır)
Ctrl + delete -> Kelimeyi olduğu gibi siliyor.

Chrome kısayol: 
Crtl+F5 or Shift+F5 -> re-download cached content (i.e. JavaScript files, images, etc…)
Normal Reload
F5 or Control + R = Reload the current page
“Ctrl+R” is the same thing as pressing f5. This will use the cache in every way possible. If the browser can avoid re-downloading JavaScript files, images, text files, etc. then it will.
Note: Having cursor in the address field and pressing ENTER will also do the same as CTRL + F5
Hard reload / Force Refresh
Control + Shift + R or Control + F5 or Shift + F5 = Reload your current page, ignoring cached content
Someone just told you to “force reload” your browser to fix something. Depending on your operating system all you need to do is the following key combination:
Windows: ctrl + F5
Mac/Apple: Apple + R or command + R
Don’t use anything in the cache when making the request. Forces the browser to re-download every JavaScript file, image, text file, etc.
Empty Cache and Hard Reload
Empty Cache and hard reload = Empty the cache and Force the browser do re-download every JavaScript file, image, text file, etc.
Obviously if the cache is empty then it will have to do a hard reload in order to load the required/support files again. This will again force the browser to re-download everything. However, if the page makes any after the fact downloads via JavaScript that weren’t part of page load, then these might still use the cache, which is where emptying the cache helps because it makes sure that even these won’t use cached files.

Step over code to skip functions
When you are on a line of code that is a function or method call, you can press F10(Debug > Step Over) instead of F11.


Advance the debugger out of the current function
Sometimes, you might want to continue your debugging session but advance the debugger all the way through the current function.
Press Shift + F11 (or Debug > Step Out).
This command resumes app execution (and advances the debugger) until the current function returns.

F10 vs F11
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15584132/what-is-the-difference-between-f10-and-f11-keys-in-visual-studio/39843982
F10 ("step over") does not descend any further into the call stack. It moves to the next line of the current function.
F11 ("step into") drills down into the function being called.
void function1()
{
    function2();
    function3();
}
If you hit a breakpoint on function2(), F10 will advance to the line function3(). F11 will advance to the first line inside function2.

F5 refreshes the web page and often reloads the same page from the cached contents of the web browser. However, reloading from cache every time is not guaranteed and it also depends upon the cache expiry.

Shift + F5 forces the web browser to ignore its cached contents and retrieve a fresh copy of the web page into the browser.

Shift + F5 guarantees loading of latest contents of the web page.
However, depending upon the size of page, it is usually slower than F5.

Object Oriented Programming / OOP / NYP  (GITHUB) 	(read)
oop nedir, object oriented programming nedir, nyp nedir

Programımız objeler üzerinden yürür. Objeler sınıflardan türetilir. Bir kalem kırmızı, diğeri mavidir. İkisi farklı objelerdir, aynı sınıftandır. Sınıfların çeşitli metotları vardır. Bir uçak uçar, bir araba yolda gider vb.
1960'lı yılların sonuna doğru ortaya çıkan bu yaklaşım, o dönemin yazılım dünyasında beliren bir bunalımın sonucudur. Yazılımların karmaşıklığı ve boyutları sürekli artıyor, ancak belli bir nitelik düzeyi korumak için gereken bakımın maliyeti zaman ve çaba olarak daha da hızlı artıyordu. NYP'yi bu soruna karşı bir çözüm haline getiren başlıca özelliği, yazılımda birimselliği (modularity) benimsemesidir. NYP ayrıca, bilgi gizleme (information hiding), veri soyutlama (data abstraction), çok biçimlilik (polymorphism) ve kalıtım (inheritance) gibi yazılımın bakımını ve aynı yazılım üzerinde birden fazla kişinin çalışmasını kolaylaştıran kavramları da yazılım literatürüne kazandırmıştır. Sağladığı bu avantajlardan dolayı, NYP günümüzde geniş çaplı yazılım projelerinde yaygın olarak kullanılmaktadır.

NYP'nin altında yatan birimselliğin ana fikri, her bilgisayar programının (izlence), etkileşim içerisinde olan birimler veya nesneler kümesinden oluştuğu varsayımıdır. Bu nesnelerin her biri, kendi içerisinde veri işleyebilir, ve diğer nesneler ile çift yönlü veri alışverişinde bulunabilir. Hâlbuki NYP'den önce var olan tek yaklaşımda (Yordamsal programlama), programlar sadece bir komut dizisi veya birer işlev (fonksiyon) kümesi olarak görülmektedirler.
Günümüzde çok çeşitli nesne tabanlı programlama dilleri olmasıyla beraber, en popüler diller sınıflar üzerine kurulmuşlardır (class-based). Bu dillerde nesneler sınıfların birer üyesidir ve nesnelerin tipini de bu sınıflar belirlerler.
En yaygın NYP dillerinden bazıları, Python, C++, Objective-C, Smalltalk, Delphi, Java, Swift, C#, Perl, Ruby ve PHP' dir.
Nesne yönelimli programlama dilleri yukarıda adı geçen tüm ögelere sahip olurken, Ada, JavaScript, Visual Basic gibi nesne tabanlı programlama dilleri birkaçından yoksundur, bu dillerin başlıca yoksunluğu kalıtıma sahip olmamalarıdır.

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.
OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained.
The organization of an object-oriented program also makes the method beneficial to collaborative development, where projects are divided into groups.
Additional benefits of OOP include code reusability, scalability and efficiency. Even when using microservices, developers should continue to apply the principles of OOP.
The first step in OOP is to collect all of the objects a programmer wants to manipulate and identify how they relate to each other -- an exercise often known as data modeling.
Examples of an object can range from physical entities, such as a human being who is described by properties like name and address, down to small computer programs, such as widgets.
Once an object is known, it is labeled with a class of objects that defines the kind of data it contains and any logic sequences that can manipulate it. Each distinct logic sequence is known as a method. Objects can communicate with well-defined interfaces called messages.
Object-oriented programming is based on the following principles:
Encapsulation. The implementation and state of each object are privately held inside a defined boundary, or class. Other objects do not have access to this class or the authority to make changes but are only able to call a list of public functions, or methods. This characteristic of data hiding provides greater program security and avoids unintended data corruption.
Abstraction. Objects only reveal internal mechanisms that are relevant for the use of other objects, hiding any unnecessary implementation code. This concept helps developers more easily make changes and additions over time.
Başka tanım abstraction nedir (Tarık Güney): Bir varlık ya da sistemi incelerken, fiziksel, mekansal, ve zamansal nitelikleri içinden ilgimizi çekmeyen kısımları ayıklamak sureti ile sadece işimize yarayan kısımlara odaklanmak.
Inheritance. Relationships and subclasses between objects can be assigned, allowing developers to reuse a common logic while still maintaining a unique hierarchy. This property of OOP forces a more thorough data analysis, reduces development time and ensures a higher level of accuracy.
Polymorphism. Objects can take on more than one form depending on the context. The program will determine which meaning or usage is necessary for each execution of that object, cutting down the need to duplicate code.
While Simula is credited as the first object-oriented programming language, the most popular OOP languages are:
Java
JavaScript
Python
C++
Visual Basic .NET
Ruby
Scala
PHP
Criticism of OOP
The object-oriented programming model has been criticized by developers for multiple reasons. The largest concern is that OOP overemphasizes the data component of software development and does not focus enough on computation or algorithms. Additionally, OOP code may be more complicated to write and take longer to compile.
Alternative methods to OOP include:
functional programming
structured programming
imperative programming
Most advanced programming languages give developers the option to combine these models.

Encapsulation   	(GITHUB) 	(read)
encapsulation nedir
w3Schools:
The meaning of Encapsulation, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. To achieve this, you must:
•	declare fields/variables as private
•	provide public get and set methods, through properties, to access and update the value of a private field
-
Encapsulation is defined 'as the process of enclosing one or more items within a physical or logical package'. Encapsulation, in object oriented programming methodology, prevents access to implementation details.
Abstraction and encapsulation are related features in object oriented programming. Abstraction allows making relevant information visible and encapsulation enables a programmer to implement the desired level of abstraction.
Encapsulation is implemented by using access specifiers. An access specifier defines the scope and visibility of a class member. C# supports the following access specifiers −
•	Public
•	Private
•	Protected
•	Internal
•	Protected internal

Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. In a different way, encapsulation is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.
•	Technically in encapsulation, the variables or data of a class are hidden from any other class and can be accessed only through any member function of own class in which they are declared.
•	As in encapsulation, the data in a class is hidden from other classes, so it is also known as data-hiding.
•	Encapsulation can be achieved by: Declaring all the variables in the class as private and using C# Properties in the class to set and get the values of variables.
 

using System;
  
public class DemoEncap
{
    // private variables declared 
    // these can only be accessed by public methods of class 
    private String studentName;
    private int studentAge;
 
    // using accessors to get and set the value of studentName 
    public String Name
    {
        get
        {
            return studentName;
        }
 
        set
        {
            studentName = value;
        }
    }
 
    // using accessors to get and set the value of studentAge 
    public int Age
    {
        get
        {
            return studentAge;
        }
 
        set
        {
            studentAge = value;
        }
    }
}
 
// Driver Class 
class GFG
{
 
    // Main Method 
    static public void Main()
    {
 
        // creating object 
        DemoEncap obj = new DemoEncap();
 
        // calls set accessor of the property Name,  
        // and pass "Ankita" as value of the  
        // standard field 'value' 
        obj.Name = "Ankita";
 
        // calls set accessor of the property Age,  
        // and pass "21" as value of the  
        // standard field 'value' 
        obj.Age = 21;
 
        // Displaying values of the variables 
        Console.WriteLine("Name: " + obj.Name);
        Console.WriteLine("Age: " + obj.Age);
    }
}


Output:
Name: Ankita
Age: 21
Explanation: In the above program the class DemoEncap is encapsulated as the variables are declared as private. To access these private variables we are using the Name and Age accessors which contains the get and set method to retrieve and set the values of private fields. Accessors are defined as public so that they can access in other class.

Advantages of Encapsulation:
•	Data Hiding: The user will have no idea about the inner implementation of the class. It will not be visible to the user that how the class is stored values in the variables. He only knows that we are passing the values to accessors and variables are getting initialized to that value.
•	Increased Flexibility: We can make the variables of the class as read-only or write-only depending on our requirement. If we wish to make the variables as read-only then we have to only use Get Accessor in the code. If we wish to make the variables as write-only then we have to only use Set Accessor.
•	Reusability: Encapsulation also improves the re-usability and easy to change with new requirements.
•	Testing code is easy: Encapsulated code is easy to test for unit testing.
-
Encapsulation: 
 
We used encapsulation to hide the balance member from the outside code. Then we provided restricted access to it using public methods. The class data can be read through the GetBalance method and modified only through the Deposit and Withdraw methods.
You cannot directly change the balance variable. You can only view its value using the public method. This helps maintain data integrity.
We could add different verification and checking mechanisms to the methods to provide additional security and prevent errors.
In summary, the benefits of encapsulation are:
   - Control the way data is accessed or modified.
   - Code is more flexible and easy to change with new requirements.
   - Change one part of code without affecting other parts of code.
it is a good practice to encapsulate members of a class and provide access to them only through public methods.

Encapsulation

        public class BankaHesabi
        {
            private double guncelPara = 0;

            public void ParaYatir(double n)
            {
                guncelPara += n;
            }
            public void ParaCek(double n)
            {
                guncelPara -= n;
            }
            public double GuncelParaGoster()
            {
                return guncelPara;
            }
        }

        static void Main()
        {
            BankaHesabi bankaHesabi1 = new BankaHesabi();
            bankaHesabi1.ParaYatir(14);
            bankaHesabi1.ParaCek(5);
            Console.WriteLine(bankaHesabi1.GuncelParaGoster());
            Console.ReadKey();
            // sonuç: 9

            // Bu programda, görüleceği üzere 'guncelPara' field'ına direkt olarak erişemiyoruz. Ancak 'public double GuncelParaGoster()' metodu ile bu field'a erişebiliyoruz.
            // İşte yapılan bu işleme Encapsulation denir.
        }

We used encapsulation to hide the guncelPara member from the outside code. Then we provided restricted access to it using public methods. The class data can be read through the GuncelParaGoster() method and modified only through the ParaYatir and ParaCek methods.
You cannot directly change the guncelPara variable. You can only view its value using the public method. This helps maintain data integrity.
We could add different verification and checking mechanisms to the methods to provide additional security and prevent errors.
In summary, the benefits of encapsulation are:
- Control the way data is accessed or modified.
- Code is more flexible and easy to change with new requirements.
- Change one part of code without affecting other parts of code.

Behavior-driven development / BDD	(GITHUB) (test)
BDD nedir Behavior-driven development nedir,  Behavior driven development nedir, Behavior driven nedir
In software engineering, behavior-driven development is an Agile software development process that encourages collaboration among developers, QA and non-technical or business participants in a software project. It encourages teams to use conversation and concrete examples to formalize a shared understanding of how the application should behave. It emerged from test-driven development (TDD).Behavior-driven development combines the general techniques and principles of TDD with ideas from domain-driven design and object-oriented analysis and design to provide software development and management teams with shared tools and a shared process to collaborate on software development.
Although BDD is principally an idea about how software development should be managed by both business interests and technical insight, the practice of BDD does assume the use of specialized software tools to support the development process.[5] Although these tools are often developed specifically for use in BDD projects, they can be seen as specialized forms of the tooling that supports test-driven development. The tools serve to add automation to the ubiquitous language that is a central theme of BDD.
BDD is largely facilitated through the use of a simple domain-specific language (DSL) using natural-language constructs (e.g., English-like sentences) that can express the behaviour and the expected outcomes. Test scripts have long been a popular application of DSLs with varying degrees of sophistication. BDD is considered an effective technical practice especially when the "problem space" of the business problem to solve is complex.

Yazılım geliştirme son yıllarda Waterfall’dan Agile metodolojisine geçiş yapmaktadır. Agile ile yazılım geliştirme sürekli değişim içerdiğinden yeni hataların ortaya çıkmasını  önlemek için test yapmak vazgeçilemez hale gelmiştir. Testler bir işin istenildiği gibi olup olmadığının en büyük göstergesidir. Öte yandan iş birimleri(business) ile yapılan testler de vardır. İş birimleri kendi alışkanlıkları ve talep edilen ürünün işleyişine göre test ederler. Yani kendi davranışsal testlerini yaparlar. Buradan yola çıkarak yeni test yaklaşımları da hayatımıza girmiştir.
Son dönemin popüler test yaklaşımlarından biri olan BDD (Behavior Driven Development) aslında TDD’ ye (Test Driven Development) alternatif olarak çıkmıştır. İki test yaklaşımı da kaliteli ve anlaşılabilir kod üretimini amaçlamaktadır. Fakat TDD yaklaşımının maliyetli oluşu ve birbirinin dilinden anlamayan birimler tarafından kullanılmaması BDD yaklaşımı ortaya çıkarmıştır. BDD yaklaşımı tüm birimler tarafından anlaşılabilen ortak bir dil kullanarak müşteri taleplerinin hızlıca yapılabilmesini ve iletişimin sağlanmasını kolaylaştırmıştır. Şimdi bu yaklaşımları detaylı bir şekilde inceleyelim.
BDD temelinde iki kısımdan oluşur. İlk kısım BT ve iş birimlerinin yazılımın nasıl davranması gerektiğini belirledikleri süreçtir. Bu süreçte iş paydaşları,geliştiriciler ve developerlar kısa ve verimli toplantılar yaparak sistemin özelliklerini ve davranışını belirlerler. İkinci kısım ise yazılımın istenildiği gibi davrandığını yazılmış otomasyon kodları ile göstermeyi hedefler. Çalıştırılan otomasyon kodları sonrasında hızlı bir şekilde test sonuçları gözlemlenir ve eksikler belirlenerek yine hızlıca aksiyon alınabilir. Şekil 3’de BDD süreçleri detaylı bir şekilde gösterilmiştir.
BDD ’nin kolay bir yazım yöntemi vardır. “Given-When-Then” olarak üç başlıkta test senaryoları kurulur. Given, belirlenen test senaryosu bu başlıkta yazılır. When, test senaryosunun gerçekleşeceği zamanı anlatılır. Then, belirlenen senaryo ve aksiyon sonrasında uygulamanın nasıl bir sonuç döneceğini anlatır. Örneğin, herhangi bir kullanıcının sisteme giriş yapmak istediğini düşünelim ve sırasıyla BDD adımlarını yazalım.
Given: Kullanıcı şifre alanına hatalı şifre girer.
When: Giriş düğmesine basar.
Then: Kullanıcıya hatalı şifre ile giriş yapmak istediğini belirten hata mesajı gösterilir.

Kanban             (GITHUB)  (test) 
Kanban nedir
Video 2 dk. Açıklayıcı: https://www.digite.com/kanban/what-is-kanban/
Kanban is a visual system for managing work as it moves through a process. Kanban visualizes both the process (the workflow) and the actual work passing through that process. The goal of Kanban is to identify potential bottlenecks in your process and fix them so work can flow through it cost-effectively at an optimal speed or throughput.
TRIVIA – Kanban, also spelt “kamban” in Japanese, translates to “Billboard” (“signboard” in Chinese) that indicates “available capacity (to work)”. Kanban is a concept related to lean and just-in-time (JIT) production, where it is used as a scheduling system that tells you what to produce, when to produce it, and how much to produce. 
Kanban, 2000’li yılların başlarında ilk kez David J. Anderson tarafından uygulanan, karakteristik özelliklerini Yalın Üretim (Lean Production) ilkerinden (özellikle Taiichi Ohno’nun 1953 yılında Toyota’da uygulamaya başladığı yalın üretim metodu kanbandan) alan ve Kısıtlar Teorisi (Theory of Constraints) yanında Sistemsel Düşünme (Systems Thinking) gibi sistemik optimize yaklaşımlarını barındıran evrimsel bir metodolojidir.
İlk başlangıçta süregelen sistemi değiştirmeden izleyerek, çöp üreten ve bekleme yaratan noktaların görselleştirilerek tespit edilmesini ve sonrasında yok edilmesi ile sistemi iyileştirmeyi ve hafifletmeyi amaçlar. Bu hafifleme ve yalınlaşma ile organizasyon daha çevik tepkiler verebilecektir. Evrimsel oluşundan dolayı diğer uygulamalarda yaşanabilecek organizasyon kültüründen kaynaklı negatif tepkiler en düşük seviyede gözlemlenir.

Scalability	(GITHUB)

Scalability nedir

Scalability is the property of a system to handle a growing amount of work by adding resources to the system. In an economic context, a scalable business model implies that a company can increase sales given increased resources.
Scalability is the trait where a software solution can handle increased loads of work. This can be larger data-sets, higher request rates, combination of size and velocity etc.
When talking about systems scalability, we usually differentiate between
"Scale up" - the ability to grow by using stronger hardware
"Scale out"- the ability to grow by adding more hardware
A solution that can scale out can usually grow to lager loads in a more cost effective way. An important thing to know here is Amdahl's law that states that the ability to scale out is limited by the sequential part of the software

Örneğin bir programda bulunan bir resim, programın içerisine dahil edilip çalıştırılabilir kodun (executable code) bir parçası olabileceği gibi, bir resim dosyası olarak hariçte tutulup programın çalışması sırasında bu harici dosyadan okunabilir. Bir varlığın bu şekilde programa dahil edilmesine microsoft terminolojisinde COM (component object model) ismi verilirken hariçte tutulmasına ole ismi verilir.
OLEDB terimi ise bu açıklamadan anlaşılacağı üzere program ile veri tabanı arasındaki bağlantının hariçte tutulması anlamındadır. Aslında MDAC ismi verilen ve microsoft tarafından geliştirilen microsoft data access components (microsoft veri erişim bileşenleri) ailesinin bir üyesi olan OLEDB, kısaca microsoft ortamlarında veritabanına (DB database) erişmek için kullanılan çeşitli yöntemlerden birisidir. Yapı olarak ODBC bağlantısına benzetilebilir.
OLEDB kullanımını daha net anlayabilmek için C# dilinde yazılmış aşağıdaki kodu anlamaya çalışalım:
using System;
using System.Data.OleDb;
public class ReadFromOleDb
{
  [STAThread]
  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    String sConn = "provider=sqloledb;server=(local)\SQLEXPRESS;database=veritabani;Integrated Security=SSPI";

    String sSQL = "select id, firstname, lastname from Employee";

    OleDbConnection oConn = new OleDbConnection(sConn);
    oConn.Open();

    OleDbCommand oCmd = new OleDbCommand(sSQL, oConn);
    OleDbDataReader oReader = oCmd.ExecuteReader();

    int idxID = oReader.GetOrdinal("id");
    int idxFirstName = oReader.GetOrdinal("firstname");
    int idxLastName = oReader.GetOrdinal("lastname");

    while(oReader.Read()) {
      Console.WriteLine("{0} {1} {2}",
        oReader.GetValue(idxID),
        oReader.GetValue(idxFirstName),
        oReader.GetValue(idxLastName));
    }
  }
}
Yukarıdaki kodda dikkat edileceği üzere System.Data.OleDb kütüphanesi kullanılmıştır. OleDb ile veritabanı işlemini 3 adımda inceleyebiliriz:
1. Veritabanı bağlantısının kurulması
2. Bağlantı üzerinde bir sorgunun (query) çalıştırılması
3. Sorgu sonucunda (şayet sorgu bir sonuç kümesi döndürüyorsa (result set) ) sonuç kümesi üzerinde işlem yapılması
Bu sıralanan adımları yukarıdaki kodda belirleyecek olursak ilk adım olan veritabanı bağlantısı
String sConn = "provider=sqloledb;server=(local)\SQLEXPRESS;database=veritabani;Integrated Security=SSPI";
OleDbConnection oConn = new OleDbConnection(sConn);
oConn.Open();
Şeklinde 3 ayrı satırda kurulmuştur.  Buradaki provider terimi sqlodedb olarak belirlenmiştir. Bunun anlamı bilgisayarımızda bu bağlantıyı sağlamaya yarayan bir sürücü (driver) bulunması gerektiği ve bağlantının isminin tam olarak sqloledb olmasıdır.
Ardından server= ile başlayan kısımda (local) yazılmıştır. Burada da aynı bilgisayar üzerinde bulunan veri tabanına bağlanılacağı anlaşılıyor. Şayet farklı bir sunucudaki bir veritabanına bağlanılması istenirse bu durumda sunucunun internet addresi ( IP address ) veya ağ kurulumuna göre  ismi yazılmalıdır.
Bu yazı şadi evren şeker tarafından yazılmış ve bilgisayarkavramlari.com sitesinde yayınlanmıştır. Bu içeriğin kopyalanması veya farklı bir sitede yayınlanması hırsızlıktır ve telif hakları yasası gereği suçtur.
database= ile başlayan kısma ise veri tabanı sunucumuzda bulunan ve bağlanılmak istenen veritabanının ismi yazılır.
Integrated Security ile SSPI ayarlanmıştır. SSPI aslında detaylıca anlatılabilecek bir güvenlik modülü olmasına karşılık bu yazıda sadece Security Support Provider Interface kelimelerinin baş harfinden oluştuğunu ve bağlantı sırasında gidip gelen verinin güvenli bir şekilde saklanmasının hedeflendiğini söylemek ile yetinelim.
Yukarıdaki bağlantıyı gösteren ikinci satırda OleDbConnection sınıfından (class) bir nesne (object) oluşturuyoruz ve ismi de oConn olarak veriliyor. Burada OleDbConnection yapıcısına (constructor) parametre olarak bir önceki saıtrda tanımladığımız dizgiyi (string) veriyoruz.
Son olarak oConn.open() metodunu çağırarak bağlantıyı açıyoruz.
Bağlantı açıldıktan sonra, bu bağlantı üzerinden artık sorgu (query) çalıştırılabilir. Sorgu çalıştıran satırlarımız aşağıda verilmiştir:
String sSQL = "select id, firstname, lastname from Employee";
OleDbCommand oCmd = new OleDbCommand(sSQL, oConn);
OleDbDataReader oReader = oCmd.ExecuteReader();
Yukarıdaki 3 satırda sırasıyla bir sorgu cümlesi (query string) girilmiş, bu cümle daha önceden açılmış olan bağlantı üzerinde çalıştırılmış ve son olarak sorgunun sonucunu okumak üzere OleDbDataReader sınıfından (class) bir nesne üretilmiştir.
Üçüncü kısımda bu sorgunun sonucu işlenmektedir.
oReader nesnesinden getOrdinal fonksiyonu ile veritabanımızda bulunan Employee tablosundaki ilgili kolonları (column) bağlayabiliyoruz:
oReader.GetOrdinal("id");
Örneğin yukarıdaki kodda “id” isimli kolon alınmıştır. Daha sonra bu bağlantılar üzerinden satır satır okuma yaparak verileri çekmemiz mümkün. while döngüsünün (loop) içindeki satırlarda da bu şekilde veri çekilerek Console.write komutu ile ekrana basılmaktadır.

DTO – Faydası nedir? (GITHUB)
DTO nedir
When you're working with a remote interface, such as Remote Facade (388), each call to it is expensive. As a result you need to reduce the number of calls, and that means that you need to transfer more data with each call. One way to do this is to use lots of parameters. However, this is often awkward to program - indeed, it's often impossible with languages such as Java that return only a single value.
The solution is to create a Data Transfer Object that can hold all the data for the call. It needs to be serializable to go across the connection. Usually an assembler is used on the server side to transfer data between the DTO and any domain objects.
Many people in the Sun community use the term "Value Object" for this pattern. I use it to mean something else. See the discussion on page 487.
Although the main reason for using a Data Transfer Object is to batch up what would be multiple remote calls into a single call, it's worth mentioning that another advantage is to encapsulate the serialization mechanism for transferring data over the wire. By encapsulating the serialization like this, the DTOs keep this logic out of the rest of the code and also provide a clear point to change serialization should you wish.
The Sun/Java community's use of terminology has changed since the book was published. They switched to using "Transfer Object" as the name for this pattern. Consequently "Value Object" became regularly used in the way that I describe in this book.

Crossing Boundaries
The most common example of this is creating an HTTP API using ASP.NET Core that returns an object from its Controller actions that are ultimately serialized to JSON. The consumer is oftentimes JavaScript that uses those JSON responses in displaying the browser using a Component or SPA Framework.
Internals
If you’re not using DTOs, then you’re likely exposing internal data structures.
The biggest culprit of this is simple TODO demo applications that expose the database entities directly. Meaning they output a serialized list of TODOs to the javascript frontend. And when you want to create a new record, they often times take the TODO object to insert directly into the database. This is leaking internals.
This is my biggest complaint with simple demo applications are they often don’t implement or follow some practices, because rightly so, they aren’t applicable to a simple TODO application. However, people take the example of a simple TODO and use the same patterns into a much large application.
The problem is when internal data objects are serialized and consumed by a client you either down own or cannot change easily. Or, which happens more often, the application itself gets very large.
Contracts
The moment you want change internal data objects, you now have to update the clients.
Take this simple example of a Customer that is an internal data structure we use through the system and likely use to persist using an ORM.
	public class Customer
	{
	  public string Name { get; set; }
	  public string Address1 { get; set; }
	  public string Address2 { get; set; }
	  public string City { get; set; }
	  public string Country { get; set; }
	}

If we are serializing this structure and clients are consuming this, if we change this structure, we’re likely going to break out clients.
	public class Customer
	{
	  public string Name { get; set; }
	  public CustomerAddress Address { get;set; } 
	}
	

	public class CustomerAddress
	{
	  public string Address1 { get; set; }
	  public string Address2 { get; set; }
	  public string City { get; set; }
	  public string Country { get; set; }
	}
view rawcustomer.cs hosted with ❤ by GitHub
This change would require a change to all of our clients. We could easily make this change in our own codebase and have all our own usages be correct, but we would be breaking all of our decoupled clients that get a serialized representation.
Representation
When creating an HTTP API, it’s all about representations. Most often times clients need a rich representation of a resource, not a just serialized version of a database entity. They often times need related data.
Having your API return rich representations means you must do some level of composition to create an object, not just a database entity, that will get serialized. This is where a DTO comes into play.
I actually don’t often use the term DTO, but rather use the word Representation or ViewModel. The purpose is still the same, it’s a data structure that is a contract between the producer and the consumer. That contract should remain stable (through backwards compatibility) or have a versioning strategy.
Coupling
The reason you want to use DTOs is that you want clients to couple to that contract, not to your internal data structures. This allows you to modify and evolve your internals freely without breaking clients.

Query String (GITHUB)
Query string endir, querystring nedir
QueryString soyut olarak nedir?
 
Sayfalar arası veri taşıma yollarından en kolayı olan QueryString yöntemi, URL üzerindeki stringler ile verileri taşımaya yarar. İnternette gezerken bir çok sitenin url adresleri garip harf ve sembollerle dolduğu dikkatinizi çekmiştir. İşte bu karakterler sunucu tarafında adrese eklenip sayfayla birlikte hareket eden QueryString'dir. Yeni sayfada bu link alınıp içindeki veriler sayfaya yerleştirilir. Fazla değerli verilerin olmadığı anlarda tercih edilmesi gereken yöntemdir çünkü taşınan veriler kullanıcının direk gözü önündedir. QueryString'in kullanımı çok kolaydır. Diğer bir güzel yanı ise URL adresinin içinde bulunmasından dolayı, sayfanın yerimlerine kaydedilmesi durumunda kendisinin de saklanmasıdır. Böylece yerimine gidildiğinde, sayfa saklandığı haldeki şekliyle açılır.

How to use Querystring Parameters in Asp.Net MVC to Retrieve or Send Data
Here we will learn query string parameters in asp.net mvc with example. Generally, the query string is one of client-side state management techniques in ASP.NET in which query string stores values in URL that are visible to Users. We mostly use query strings to pass data from one page to another page in asp.net mvc.
 
In asp.net mvc routing has support for query strings in RouteConfig.cs let’s have a look on. Our routing class file RouteConfig.cs  will contain id as an Optional Parameter.
 
public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes)
{
routes.IgnoreRoute("{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}");
routes.MapRoute(
name: "Default",
url: "{controller}/{action}/{id}",
defaults: new
{
controller = "Home",
action = "Index",
id = UrlParameter.Optional
});
}
In asp.net mvc we can pass query string with Optional Parameter and also without Optional Parameter.
 
Query strings with Optional Parameter
 
http://localhost:2151/MyHome/index?Name=sai&&Age=50 
 
Query strings without Optional Parameters 
 
http://localhost:2151/MyHome/index/1?Name=sai&&Age=50 
Create New Asp.Net MVC Application
We will learn query strings with a simple example for that Open visual studio  Go to File  Select New  Select Project.
 
 
 
After that, you will see a new dialog for selecting your Template and Project type. From Templates, select Visual C#  inside that select Web and then project type select ASP.NET MVC 4 Web Application, and here we are giving the name as “Tutorial9_Querystring” then finally click on ok button.
 
 
 
 After naming it, click on OK now new dialog will pop up for selecting a template in that Select Basic template, view engine as Razor, and click ok like as shown below.
 
 
 
After that, visual studio will create a new project for us based on our configuration that will be like as shown below.
 
 
 
Now we will create a Controller with the Name MyHomeController.
Adding New Controller (MyHomeController) in Application
To add controller, right-click on the Controller folder, select Add from the list, and inside that select controller.
 
 
 
After selecting the controller, a new dialog will popup with the name Add Controller in that give name as "MyHomeController". In the template, we are going to select the Empty MVC controller as shown below.
 
 
 
After creating the controller, here is a code snippet of it.
 
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.Mvc;
 
namespace Tutorial9_Querystring.Controllers
{
public class MyHomeController : Controller
{
//
// GET: /MyHome/
public ActionResult Index()
{
return View();
}
}
}
Creating index ActionMethod [With Optional Parameter]
After adding the controller, now let's add parameters to the index action method. This action method has an optional parameter (ID) with 2 other parameter Names and departments.
 
public ActionResult Index(string ID, string Name, string Department)
{
return View();
}
Save Application and Run it
Now let's run the application and access the URL. For calling this URL first, we are going to call Controller [MyHome], then following with Action Method [Index], lastly with an optional parameter[10], then query string will be like [? Name=saineshwar&&Department=SoftwareDevelopment].
 
E.g., the URL will be like  http://localhost:2151/MyHome/Index/10?Name=saineshwar&&Department=SoftwareDevelopment 
 
 Below is a complete snapshot of how to pass the Query string.
 
 
Output after passing Query string [With Optional Parameter].
 
 
 
Following is the snapshot while debugging.
 
 
Creating Details ActionMethod [Without Optional Parameter]
Now let’s create Action Method with Name Details, and this method will be without optional parameters. We will pass 2 parameters, Name and Department, that will be like as shown below.
 
public ActionResult Details(string Name, string Department)
{
string result = " Name= " Name " Department= " Department;
return Content(result);
}
Save Application and Running it
Let's Run the Application and access URL. For calling this URL first, we are going to call Controller [MyHome], then following with ActionMethod [Details], then lastly, query string that will be like as [? Name=saineshwar&&Department=SoftwareDevelopment]
 
E.g., the URL will be like http://localhost:2151/MyHome/Details?Name=saineshwar&Department=SoftwareDevelopment 
 
 
 
Following is the snapshot while debugging
 
 
Now we completed query string in asp.net mvc with accessing URL now let’s call Action Method from Action Link from passing Query string. Calling Action method from Action Link with Passing Query string. 
 
With Optional Parameters
 
@Html.ActionLink("Call Index Action", "Index", new { ID = 10, Name = 3, Department = "test" })
Without Optional Parameters
 
@Html.ActionLink("Call Details Action", "Details", new { Name = 3, Department = "test" })
