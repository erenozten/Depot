Executable Code (GITHUB)
Executable Code nedir
Software in a form that can be run in the computer. Executable code generally refers to machine language, which is the set of native instructions the computer carries out in hardware. Executable files in the DOS/Windows world use .EXE and .COM file extensions, while executable files in Mac, Linux and Unix do not require specific extensions. They are identified by their file structure.

Executable code may also refer to programs written in interpreted languages that require additional software to actually execute. Some interpreted languages remain in their source code form, such as JavaScript and VBScript, while others are compiled into an intermediate language, such as Java and Visual Basic. Interpreted languages require software "runtime engines" to convert the program into executable instructions for a particular CPU family that the hardware executes. See machine language, runtime engine, linker, compiler, intermediate language, x86 and Java Virtual Machine.

J# (GITHUB)
J# nedir 
Visual J# (pronounced "jay-sharp") is an implementation of the J# programming language that was a transitional language for programmers of Java and Visual J++ languages, so they could use their existing knowledge and applications with the .NET Framework.[1][2] It was introduced in 2002 and discontinued in 2007, with support for the final release of the product continuing until October 2017.
Fundamental differences between J# and Java
Java and J# use the same general syntax but there are non-Java conventions in J# to support the .NET environment. For example, to use .NET "properties" with a standard JavaBean class, it is necessary to prefix getter and setter methods with the Javadoc-like annotation:            /** @beanproperty   */ 
J# does not compile Java-language source code to Java bytecode.
JavaWorld said: "J#'s interface to the .NET framework is solid, but not as seamless as C#. In particular, J# code cannot define new .NET attributes, events, value types, or delegates. J# can make use of these language constructs if they are defined in an assembly written in another language, but its inability to define new ones limits J#'s reach and interoperability compared to other .NET languages."[5]

Statik Tipli Diller İle Dinamik Tipli Diller Arasındaki Farklar 	(GITHUB)

Programlama dillerinde tip sistemleri, değerleri belirli tiplerde gruplarlar. Aynı değerler,belirlenen tip adı altında gruplanarak yazılım geliştiricilerin veriyi çok daha etkili ve anlamlı kullanmasına olanak sağlar. Verinin işlenip çıktı olarak alınması noktasında verilerin etkili ve hataya yol açmadan işlenmesi çok önemlidir. Birbirinden alakasız veriler üzerinde işlem yapılması tip sistemlerinin getirdiği bu özellik sayesinde önlenir. Örneğin; Bir Integer ile bir Boolean değer aynı ifade içinde kullanılıp anlamsız bir değer çıkması tip sistemleri sayesinde önlenir.
Programlama dillerinde yapılan her işlem öncesi hataları önlemek için verilerin tip kontrolü yapılır. Bu tür kontrollere ”Checking”  adı verilir. Checking işlemleri compile-time (derleme esnasında) veya run-time (çalışma esnasında) olarak yapılır. İşte bu farklılık Statik Tipli ve Dinamik Tipli dillerin temel ayrım noktalarından biridir.
Statik Tipli dillerde her değişkenin değişmez bir tipi olmak zorundadır. Uygulama geliştire ya bu tipi bizzat belirler yada Derleyici tarafından belirlenir. Statik Tipli dillerde yapılan işlemlerden önce Tip Konrolü yapıldığı için, operandların tiplerinin belirlenmesi gerekir. Tip kontrolleri compile (derleme) esnasında yapılır. Bu tarz dillere örnek olarak Java, C, C++ ,C# ,F# ,Ada ,Fortran ,Haskell ,ML ,Objective-C ,Pascal dilleri verilebilir.
Dinamik Tipli dillerde değerler değişmez bir tipe sahiptir. Ancak değişkenler ve ifadelerin belirli bir tipe sahip olma zorunlulukları yoktur. Her bir işlem esnasında, operandlar değişik değerler üretebilir. Değişkenlerin ve ifadelerin tipleri run-time (çalışma) esnasında belirlenir. Bu tarz dillere örnek olarak Groovy, Javascript, Lisp, Lua, PHP, Prolog, Python, Ruby, Smalltalk dilleri verilebilir.
Statik Tipli Diller ile Dinamik Tipli dillerin birbirlerine üstünlükleri konusunda birçok fikir ortaya atılıyor. İkisinin de birbirlerine üstün oldukları noktalar var.
Statik Tipli dillerde derleme (compile-time) esnasında tip kontrolü yapıldığı için programın çalışması esnasında ekstra tip kontrolü yapılmaz, bu da uygulamanın çok daha verimli ve hızlı çalışması anlamına gelir. Dinamik Tipli dillerde ise çalışma (run-time) esnasında kontrol yapılması ufak da olsa bir yavaşlamaya sebep olmaktadır. Ayrıca yine bu özellikten dolayı her değişkenin tip bilgisi hafızada saklanmak zorundadır. Bu durum ekstra bir hafıza yükü anlamına gelir. Statik Tipli dillerde derleme (compile-time) esnasında tip kontrolü yapıldığı için ekstra bir hafızaya gerek duyulmaz.
Statik Tipli dillerde derleme (compile-time) esnasında herhangi bir hata yakalanmadı ise tip hatası oluşmamış demektir yani Dinamik Tipli dillere nazaran çok daha güvenlidir. Dinamik Tipli dillerde ise böyle bir kesinlik bulunmaz. Öte yandan Dinamik Tipli diller Developer’lara çok büyük esneklik sağlar. Gelen verinin türünün bilinmediği uygulamalarda çok kullanışlıdır. Ayrıca uygulama geliştirenler bir değişkene farklı noktalarda farklı değerler atayabilirler.

Entity Framework için constructor (GITHUB)
Entity Framework için constructor

class User(
..
..
public User(bilmemNe bilmemNe){
}

protected User(){
}

)

içine parametre alan bir constructor oluşturmuşsan eğer:

parametresiz bir constructor da oluşturmalısın. Boş kalsın. Neden bunu yapmamız gerekiyor?

Entity framework, User class'ının instance'ını bu parametreli constructor'u kullanarak oluşturamaz da ondan. Bir düşün. Entity framework nasıl instance oluştursun (veya obje initialize etsin) eğer boş bir constructor yoksa?

O yüzden,

Boş ctor oluşturmamız gerekiyor. Bu boş ctor wrong state'e girmemize yol açabilir. Yani boş olan ctor bazı sıkıntılara yol açabilir. O yüzden boş ctor'u protected yapabiliriz. Çok iyi olur.

Navigation Property (GITHUB)
Navigation property nedir
A navigation property is an optional property on an entity type that allows for navigation from one end of an association to the other end. Unlike other properties, navigation properties do not carry data.
A navigation property definition includes the following:
•	A name. (Required)
•	The association that it navigates. (Required)
•	The ends of the association that it navigates. (Required)
Önemli:
Navigation properties are optional on both entity types at the ends of an association. If you define a navigation property on one entity type at the end of an association, you do not have to define a navigation property on the entity type at the other end of the association.
The data type of a navigation property is determined by the multiplicity of its remote association end. For example, suppose a navigation property, OrdersNavProp, exists on a Customer entity type and navigates a one-to-many association between Customer and Order. Because the remote association end for the navigation property has multiplicity of many (*), its data type is a collection (of Order). Similarly, if a navigation property, CustomerNavProp, exists on the Order entity type, its data type would be Customer, because the multiplicity of the remote end is one (1).

ERRORS  (GITHUB)
404: Links that don’t lead anywhere are known as 'dead links' or 'broken links'. The HTTP status code 404 is often referred to as 'error 404', 'HTTP 404', or '404 code'.
The typical trigger for an error 404 message is when website content has been removed or moved to another URL. There are also other reasons why an error message could appear. These include:

The URL or its content (such as files or images) was either deleted or moved (without adjusting any internal links accordingly)
The URL was writtenincorrectly (during the creation process or a redesign), linkedincorrectly, or typed into the browser incorrectly
The server responsible for the website is not running or the connection is broken
The requested domain name can’t be converted to an IP by the domain name system (DNS)
The entered domain name doesn’t exist (anymore)

An interface is a completely abstract class, which contains only abstract members.
It is declared using the interface keyword:

        public interface IShape
        {
            void Draw();
        }

All members of the interface are by default abstract, so no need to use the abstract keyword. 
Also, all members of an interface are always public, and no access modifiers can be applied to them.
It is common to use the capital letter I as the starting letter for an interface name.
Interfaces can contain properties, methods, etc. but cannot contain fields (variables).
When a class implements an interface, it must also implement, or define, all of its methods.
The term implementing an interface is used (opposed to the term "inheriting from") to describe the process of creating a class based on an interface. The interface simply describes what a class should do. The class implementing the interface must define how to accomplish the behaviors.
The syntax to implement an interface is the same as that to derive a class: 

        public interface IShape
        {
            void Draw();
        }
        class Circle : IShape
        {
            public void Draw()
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Circle Draw");
            }
        }
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            IShape c = new Circle();
            c.Draw();
            //Outputs "Circle Draw"
        }

Note, that the override keyword is not needed when you implement an interface.

But why use interfaces rather than abstract classes? 
A class can inherit from just one base class, but it can implement multiple interfaces!
Therefore, by using interfaces you can include behavior from multiple sources in a class.
To implement multiple interfaces, use a comma separated list of interfaces when creating the class: class A: IShape, IAnimal, etc.

HTTPGet vs HTTPPost	(GITHUB) 
Httpget nedir httppost nedir
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Un2JTC7tFPI
Videoyu izle…
Get yapınca veriler url ye yazılır. Post ta ise form yollanır… Url ile yollanmaz veri. Message body içinde yollanır.
Get metotlara url'ye yazıp enter yaparak ulaşılır. O yüzden tehlikeli olabilir…
DB'deki değerleri hem Get hem Post ile değiştirebiliriz tabi ki. Ama dediğimiz gibi get ile bunu yapmak tehlikelidir.

HTTPPost method hides information from URL and does not bind data to URL. It is more secure than HttpGet method but it is slower than HttpGet. It is only useful when you are passing sensitive information to the server.
The GET Method
GET is used to request data from a specified resource. 
GET is one of the most common HTTP methods. 
Note that the query string (name/value pairs) is sent in the URL of a GET request: 
/test/demo_form.php?name1=value1&name2=value2
Some other notes on GET requests: 
GET requests can be cached
GET requests remain in the browser history
GET requests can be bookmarked
GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data
GET requests have length restrictions
GET requests are only used to request data (not modify)

The POST Method
POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource. 
The data sent to the server with POST is stored in the request body of the HTTP request: 
POST /test/demo_form.php HTTP/1.1
Host: w3schools.com
name1=value1&name2=value2
(yukarıda request body'nin neye benzediğini görmüş olduk. Get request'lerde request body yoktur. Veri url'den gönderilir)
Some other notes on POST requests:
POST requests are never cached
POST requests do not remain in the browser history
POST requests cannot be bookmarked
POST requests have no restrictions on data length

GET methodu HTTP istekleri arasındaki varsayılan yöntemdir.  GET metodu ile yapılan istekler tarayıcının adres satırında görünür. Sadece belirli boyutta veri gönderileceği zaman kullanılır.
POST metodu ise URL’ de görünmesini istemediğimiz veriler olduğunda kullanılabilir. POST yönteminde gönderebileceğimiz verinin boyutu ile ilgili bir sınır yoktur. Ayrıca gönderdiğimiz parametrelerin adres satırında görünmemesi dolayısıyla GET yöntemine göre daha güvenlidir. HTML form gönderileceği zaman neredeyse her zaman POST yöntemi tercih edilir.
Örnek vermek gerekirse Kisilers tablomuzun olduğu bir proje üzerinde kişi bilgilerini düzenlemek isteyebiliriz. Bunun için genellikle iki Action oluştururuz. Bunlardan biri kişinin ID sini parametre olarak alan gelen ID ye göre kişinin bilgilerini Edit formunda açan Action iken diğeri POST olduğunda yani Kaydet butonuna tıklandığında kullanılacak Actiondur.

public ActionResult Edit(int? id)
{
if (id == null)
{  return new HttpStatusCodeResult(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest);  } 
Kisiler kisiler = db.Kisilers.Find(id);
if (kisiler == null) 
{
return HttpNotFound();
}
return View(kisiler);
} 
Yukarıda ki Action’ da querystring’imiz kisa iken aşağıdakinde Kisilers tablosundaki kolon sayısına göre uzunluğu değişecek bir querystring söz konusu. Ayrıca buradan dönen bilgilerinde adres çubuğunda görünmesini istemediğimiz için POST methodunu kullanırız.

Önemli:
Browsers can cache GET requests, generally on static data, like images or scripts. But you can also allow browsers to cache GET requests to controller actions as well, using [OutputCache] or other similar ways, so if caching is turned on for a GET controller action, it's possible that clicking on a link leading to /Home/Index doesn't actually run the Index method on the server, but rather allows the browser to serve up the page from its own cache.
With this line of thinking, you can safely turn on caching on GET actions in which the data you're serving up doesn't change (or doesn't change often), with the knowledge that your server action won't fire every time.
POSTs won't be cached by the browser, so any POST is guaranteed to make it to the server.

Güzel bir açıklama:
Ignore caching for a moment. Another way of thinking about this is that search engines will store HTTP GET links during their indexing/crawling process, therefore they will show up in search results.
Suppose if your /Home/Index is implemented as GET but it lets say deletes a row in your Database, every time this link shows up on a search engine and somebody clicks it, you will have a delete row, and soon you have a lot deleted rows.

Mutable / Immutable
Mutable nedir, immutable nedir:
Mutable and Immutable ?
In English Language Mutable means "can change" and immutable means "cannot change". The term Immutable Object means that the state of the Object cannot change after its creation. An immutable type sets the property or state of the object as read only because it cannot be modified after it is assigned during initialization.
Is String in .Net immutable ?
Yes, the String in .Net is immutable. The System.String class is an immutable type provided in the .NET framework class library. Since a String is an immutable type, it cannot be modified. When you modify a string you are actually creating a new string object with the desired value.
e.g.
 
The above code will create 1000 new string variables in the memory.
Immutability of strings has positive significance in multithreaded applications because it provides automatic thread safety. Instances of immutable types are inherently thread-safe, because no thread can modify it.
The main drawback of immutable types is that they require more resources than other object types. Because each time it modified, it creates a new one.
The above code segment creates 1000 new string variables. In these type of situations you should use the StringBuilder class, which allows you to modify the text without making new String class instances. StringBuilder is a Mutable type, that means when you alter it , it still holding same data.

Pointer
Pointer nedir?

C# supports pointers in a limited extent. A C# pointer is nothing but a variable that holds the memory address of another type. 

But in C# pointer can only be declared to hold the memory address of value types and arrays. Unlike reference types, pointer types are not tracked by the default garbage collection mechanism. For the same reason pointers are not allowed to point to a reference type or even to a structure type which contains a reference type. We can say that pointers can point to only unmanaged types which includes all basic data types, enum types, other pointer types and structs which contain only unmanaged types.

Stack: static memory allocation, çok hızlı. Allocation compile sırasında olur. Ne kadar memory e ihtiyacın olduğunu kestirebiliyosan Stack kullan.

Heap: Dynamic memory allocation, allocation run time'da olur. Bu memory'e erişim yavaştır. Dependency yoktur sağdaki soldaki elementlere. Yani kolayca silip memory yi boşaltabilirsin. Bu olaylar işi kompleksleştirir ve memorynin neresi boş neresi dolu bilmeyi zorlaştırır. Ne kadar memory e ihtiyacın olduğunu kestiremiyorsan bunu kullan. Üst üste yığma alegorisi. Yığ yığabildiğin kadar. Aynı alegoriden ötürü -> yavaş çalışır --> neyin nerede olduğu belirsiz çünkü üst üste yığıyorsun. Stack ise hızlı çünkü herşey düzgün şeklide üst üste koyuluyor.

Semantics 
semantics nedir, semantic nedir
In programming language theory, semantics is the field concerned with the rigorous mathematical study of the meaning of programming languages. It does so by evaluating the meaning of syntactically valid strings defined by a specific programming language, showing the computation involved. In such a case that the evaluation would be of syntactically invalid strings, the result would be non-computation. Semantics describes the processes a computer follows when executing a program in that specific language. This can be shown by describing the relationship between the input and output of a program, or an explanation of how the program will be executed on a certain platform, hence creating a model of computation.
Formal semantics, for instance, helps to write compilers, better understand what a program is doing, and to prove, e.g., that the following if statement
if 1 == 1 then S1 else S2
has the same effect as S1 alone.
Overview
The field of formal semantics encompasses all of the following:
•	The definition of semantic models
•	The relations between different semantic models
•	The relations between different approaches to meaning
•	The relation between computation and the underlying mathematical structures from fields such as logic, set theory, model theory, category theory, etc.
It has close links with other areas of computer science such as programming language design, type theory, compilers and interpreters, program verification and model checking.

Extension Methods in C#  (GITHUB)
Extension methods are static methods, which are called as if they were instance methods on the extended type. With Extension methods, you can add methods to existing types without even creating a new derived type, recompiling, or modifying the original type.
The following is the extension method we have created.
public static int myExtensionMethod(this string str) {
   return Int32.Parse(str);
}
Let us see an example wherein we have used extension method.
Example
Live Demo
using System;
using System.Text;
namespace Program {
   public static class Demo {
      public static int myExtensionMethod(this string str) {
         return Int32.Parse(str);
      }
   }
   class Program {
      static void Main(string[] args) {
         string str1 = "565";
         int n = str1.myExtensionMethod();
         Console.WriteLine("Result: {0}", n);
         Console.ReadLine();
      }
   }
}
Output
Result: 565

Type Safety / Type Safe		(GITHUB)	
Type safety nedir, type safe nedir type-safe neir
Type safety means preventing type errors. Type error occurs when data type of one type is assigned to other type UNKNOWINGLY and we get undesirable results.
Type-safety should not be confused with static / dynamic typing or strong / weak typing.
A type-safe language is one where the only operations that one can execute on data are the ones that are condoned by the data's type. That is, if your data is of type X and X doesn't support operation y, then the language will not allow you to to execute y(X).
This definition doesn't set rules on when this is checked. It can be at compile time (static typing) or at runtime (dynamic typing), typically through exceptions. It can be a bit of both: some statically typed languages allow you to cast data from one type to another, and the validity of casts must be checked at runtime (imagine that you're trying to cast an Object to a Consumer - the compiler has no way of knowing whether it's acceptable or not).
Type-safety does not necessarily mean strongly typed, either - some languages are notoriously weakly typed, but still arguably type safe. Take Javascript, for example: its type system is as weak as they come, but still strictly defined. It allows automatic casting of data (say, strings to ints), but within well defined rules. There is to my knowledge no case where a Javascript program will behave in an undefined fashion, and if you're clever enough (I'm not), you should be able to predict what will happen when reading Javascript code.
An example of a type-unsafe programming language is C: reading / writing an array value outside of the array's bounds has an undefined behaviour by specification. It's impossible to predict what will happen. C is a language that has a type system, but is not type safe.

In computer science, type safety is the extent to which a programming language discourages or prevents type errors. A type error is erroneous or undesirable program behaviour caused by a discrepancy between differing data types for the program's constants, variables, and methods (functions), e.g., treating an integer (int) as a floating-point number (float). Type safety is sometimes alternatively considered to be a property of a computer program rather than the language in which that program is written; that is, some languages have type-safe facilities that can be circumvented by programmers who adopt practices that exhibit poor type safety. The formal type-theoretic definition of type safety is considerably stronger than what is understood by most programmers.

operand
operand nedir

int a = 2;
int b = 3;
int c = a * b;
yukarıdaki int c = a * b;  
işlemindeki a ve b değişkenlerine operand denir. 
a değişkeni: sol operand
b değişkeni: sağ operand
Kaynak: aşağıdaki text
+	Adds two operands
-	Subtracts the second operand from the first
*	Multiplies both operands
/	Divides the numerator by de-numerator
%	Modulus Operator and a remainder of after an integer division
++	Increment operator increases integer value by one
--	Decrement operator decreases integer value by one

Relational Operators
These are operators used for performing Relational operations on numbers. Below is the list of relational operators available in C#.
Operator	Description
==	Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true.
!=	Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true.
>	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.
<	Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.
>=	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.
<=	Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.

operator
operator nedir, operatör nedir operators nedir, operatörler nedir
+  -  *  / << == >> gibi işaretler operatördür.
Operator in C# is a special symbol that specifies which operations to perform on operands. For example, in mathematics the plus symbol (+) signifies the sum of the left and right numbers. In the same way, C# has many operators that have different meanings based on the data types of the operands. C# operators usually have one or two operands. Operators that have one operand are called Unary operators.
The following table list some of the operators available in C#.
Operator category	Operators
Primary	x.y
Unary	+x
Multiplicative	x * y
Additive	x + y
Shift	x << y
Relational and type testing	x < y
Equality	x == y
Logical AND	x & y
Logical XOR	x ^ y
Logical OR	x | y
Conditional AND	x && y
Conditional OR	x || y
Null-coalescing	x ?? y
Conditional	?:
Assignment and lambda expression	x = y
As mentioned before, certain operators have different meanings based on the datatype of the operand. For example, if the + operator is used with numbers, it will add the numbers but if it is used with strings, it will concatenate the two strings.
When an operator does different things based on the datatype of the operands, it is called operator over loading.
The following C# code shows the use of the + sign operator on different datatypes:

Example: + Operator
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    string message1 = "Hello";

    string message2 = message1 + " World!!";    

    Console.WriteLine(message2);

    int i = 10, j = 20;

    int sum = i + j;

    Console.WriteLine("{0} + {1} = {2}", i, j, sum);

F# / F Sharp 
Fsharp nedir f sharp nedir f# nedir
F# originates from Microsoft Research, Cambridge, UK. The language was originally designed and implemented by Don Syme,[6] according to whom in the fsharp team, they say the F is for "Fun".[24] Andrew Kennedy contributed to the design of units of measure.[6] The Visual F# Tools for Visual Studio are developed by Microsoft.[6] The F# Software Foundation developed the F# open-source compiler and tools, incorporating the open-source compiler implementation provided by the Microsoft Visual F# Tools team.[11]

F# (pronounced F sharp) is a general purpose, strongly typed, multi-paradigm programming language that encompasses functional, imperative, and object-oriented programming methods. F# is most often used as a cross-platform Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) language, but it can also generate JavaScript[9] and graphics processing unit (GPU) code.[10]

Syntax:
F# da göze çarpan ilk önemli komut "let" dir. Bu komut ile bir değişkene değeri kaydederiz. Örnek: 
let ahmet = 10 <- 19

Operator Overloading
[operator overloading nedir] 

Most operators in C# can be overloaded, meaning they can be redefined for custom actions.
For example, you can redefine the action of the plus (+) operator in a custom class.

class Box
{
    public int Height { get; set; }
    public int Width { get; set; }
    public Box(int h, int w)
    {
        Height = h;
        Width = w;
    }
    public static Box operator +(Box a, Box b) // eksi işareti de kullanılabilirdi. Sonuç değişmez. Operatörle ilgisi yok yani. + - * / hepsi aynı sonuç.
    {
        int h = a.Height + b.Height;
        int w = a.Width + b.Width;
        Box res = new Box(h, w);
        return res;
    }
}
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Box b1 = new Box(14, 3);
    Box b2 = new Box(5, 7);
    Box b3 = b1 + b2;
 
    Console.WriteLine(b3.Height); //19
    Console.WriteLine(b3.Width); //10
    Console.ReadKey();
}

The method  public static Box operator +(Box a, Box b) defines an overloaded operator + with two Box object parameters and returning a new Box object whose Height and Width properties equal the sum of its parameter's corresponding properties.
Additionally, the overloaded operator must be static.

String  	(GITHUB)
String nedir
Note that you do not use the new operator to create a string object except when initializing the string with an array of chars.
Msdn goes here:
A string is an object of type String whose value is text. Internally, the text is stored as a sequential read-only collection of Char objects. There is no null-terminating character at the end of a C# string; therefore a C# string can contain any number of embedded null characters ('\0'). The Length property of a string represents the number of Char objects it contains, not the number of Unicode characters. To access the individual Unicode code points in a string, use the StringInfo object.
string vs. System.String
In C#, the string keyword is an alias for String. Therefore, String and string are equivalent, and you can use whichever naming convention you prefer. 
Declaring and Initializing Strings
You can declare and initialize strings in various ways, as shown in the following example:
(declare nedir örnek, initialization nedir örnek)
// Declare without initializing.
string message1;

// Initialize to null.
string message2 = null;

// Initialize as an empty string.
// Use the Empty constant instead of the literal "".
string message3 = System.String.Empty;

// Initialize with a regular string literal.
string oldPath = "c:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio 8.0";

// Initialize with a verbatim string literal.
string newPath = @"c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0";

// Use System.String if you prefer.
System.String greeting = "Hello World!";

// In local variables (i.e. within a method body)
// you can use implicit typing.
var temp = "I'm still a strongly-typed System.String!";

// Use a const string to prevent 'message4' from
// being used to store another string value.
const string message4 = "You can't get rid of me!";

// Use the String constructor only when creating
// a string from a char*, char[], or sbyte*. See
// System.String documentation for details.
char[] letters = { 'A', 'B', 'C' };
string alphabet = new string(letters);

Note that you do not use the new operator to create a string object except when initializing the string with an array of chars.
Initialize a string with the Empty constant value to create a new String object whose string is of zero length. The string literal representation of a zero-length string is "". By initializing strings with the Empty value instead of null, you can reduce the chances of a NullReferenceException occurring. Use the static IsNullOrEmpty(String) method to verify the value of a string before you try to access it.

Web Server	 (GITHUB)
Web server nedir

Web server ya da ağ sunucusu, internet üzerinde bir web sitesinin yayınından sorumlu olan sunucudur. Web server, Hosting ya da “barındırma” işlemini internet protokolü üzerinden sunan bir sunucudur. 
A Web server is software or hardware that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and other protocols to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web (WWW). Web server software controls how a user accesses hosted files. It is accessed through the domain names of websites and ensures the delivery of the site's content to the requesting user. As hardware, a Web server is a computer that holds web server software and other files related to a website, such as HTML documents, images and JavaScript files. Web server hardware is connected to the internet and allows data to be exchanged with other connected devices.
The Web server process is an example of the client/server model. All computers that host Web sites must have Web server software. Leading Web servers include Apache, Microsoft's Internet Information Server (IIS) and Nginx -- pronounced engine X. Other Web servers include Novell's NetWare server, Google Web Server (GWS) and IBM's family of Domino servers.
Web servers often come as part of a larger package of internet- and intranet-related programs that are used for:
•	Sending and receiving emails.
•	Downloading requests for File Transfer Protocol (FTP) files.
•	Building and publishing Web pages.
Considerations in choosing a Web server include how well it works with the operating system and other servers; its ability to handle server-side programming; security characteristics; and the particular publishing, search engine and site building tools that come with it.
So basically a web server is the software that receives your request to access a web page. It runs a few security checks on your HTTP request and takes you to the web page. Depending on the page you have requested, the page may ask the server to run a few extra modules while generating the document to serve you. It then serves you the document you requested. Pretty awesome isn’t it.

Web server ya da ağ sunucusu, internet üzerinde bir web sitesinin yayınından sorumlu olan sunucudur. Web server, Hosting ya da “barındırma” işlemini internet protokolü üzerinden sunan bir sunucudur. Barındırma ya da hosting, Web sayfalarını internette yayınlamak için gerekli alanın kiralanmasıdır. Diğer bir ifade ile hosting, bir Web sitesinde yayınlanmak istenen sayfaların, resimlerin veya dokümanların internet kullanıcıları tarafından erişebileceği bir bilgisayarda tutulmasıdır.

Terminal 	(GITHUB)
Terminal nedir

Terminal, Apple bilgisayarları ve Linux işletim sistemi kullanılan bilgisayarların içerisinde yer alan, kullanıcıların bir klavye ve ekran yardımıyla işletim sistemi yada yazılımları kontrol etmesine yardımcı olan komut ekranıdır. 

A terminal is simply a text-based interface to the computer. In a terminal, you can type commands, manipulate files, execute programs, and open documents. When working in a terminal, the current directory is called your working directory. A terminal will usually start in the top-level directory of your account.
Directories are separated by a backslash /. The topmost directory is indicated by a single backslash. The total directory tree is all relative to the top level directory.
On MacOS, there is a Volumes directory at the top that lists all mounted drives (networked or local). So if you have mounted your network directory, the path to it will look like the following if you substitute your username for mine.
/Volumes/Personal/bmaxwell
In a terminal, you generally type a command and any modifiers or arguments the command requires, then hit return and the command is executed. For example, to set your current (working) directory to your home directory, type cd and the prompt and hit return. Below is an example of a terminal and some commands.

Windows PowerShell 	(GITHUB)
Windows powershell nedir

To give you a better understanding of PowerShell, we should first define what a shell is. No, we're not talking about a turtle's shell. :) In computer science, a shell is a user interface that gives you access to various services of an operating system. A shell can be command-line based, or it can include a graphical user interface (GUI).
Windows PowerShell is a shell initially developed by Microsoft for the purposes of task automation and configuration management. PowerShell is now an open source project, and it can be installed on Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. This shell is based on the .NET framework, and it includes a command-line shell and a scripting language.

Windows PowerShell, Microsoft tarafından Windows komut satırı cmd.exe ve Windows Script Host'a alternatif olarak geliştirilen yeni nesil bir komut satırı uygulamasıdır. Windows PowerShell'in sunduğu yeni komut yapısı Unix sistemindeki komut yapısına benzemektedir. Kullanıcı herhangi bir komutu çalıştırdığında farklı komutlar ile bağ kurabilmektedir. Windows PowerShell 30 Kasım 2006'da ilk olarak Windows Vista işletim sisteminin bir parçası olarak planlanmıştır. Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 ile beraber ilk kez piyasaya sürülmüştür. Windows PowerShell 1.0 sürümü Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 ve Windows Vista için ücretsiz indirilebilmektedir. Windows 7'den itibaren Windows PowerShell 2.0 işletim sistemi ile beraber gelmektedir. Windows PowerShell 2.0 bir önceki sürümünden farklı olarak görsel kullanıcı arayüzüne sahptir.

Variable nedir, değişken nedir

Creating a variable reserves a memory location, or a space in memory, for storing values. 
To use a variable, it must first be declared by specifying the name and data type. 
A variable name, also called an identifier, can contain letters, numbers and the underscore character (_) and must start with a letter or underscore. 
For example, firstName and lastName are good descriptive variable names.

Json		(GITHUB)
json nedir
Json türündeki veriler iki parçadan oluşur: key (anahtar) ve value (değer). Anahtar’da nesnenin hangi özelliğinin olduğu (koddaki değişken ismi gibi düşünülebilir) tanımlanırken değerde ise anahtar özelliğinin değeri (değişkenin değeri) tanımlanır. Nesnelerdeki anahtar ve değerler string türünde tanımlanır. Aşağıda basit bir json nesnesi örneği bulunmaktadır.
{
   "Ad": "Veysel Uğur",
   "Soyad": "Kızmaz"
}


Detay:

What Is JSON?
JSON is short for JavaScript Object Notation, and is a way to store information in an organized, easy-to-access manner. In a nutshell, it gives us a human-readable collection of data that we can access in a really logical manner.
Storing JSON Data
As a simple example, information about me might be written in JSON as follows:
	var jason = {
		"age" : "24",
		"hometown" : "Missoula, MT",
		"gender" : "male"
	};
view rawgistfile1.js hosted with   by GitHub
This creates an object that we access using the variable jason. By enclosing the variable’s value in curly braces, we’re indicating that the value is an object. Inside the object, we can declare any number of properties using a "name": "value" pairing, separated by commas. To access the information stored in jason, we can simply refer to the name of the property we need. For instance, to access information about me, we could use the following snippets:
	document.write('Jason is ' jason.age); // Output: Jason is 24
	document.write('Jason is a ' jason.gender); // Output: Jason is a male
view rawgistfile1.js hosted with   by GitHub
Storing JSON Data in Arrays
A slightly more complicated example involves storing two people in one variable. To do this, we enclose multiple objects in square brackets, which signifies an array. For instance, if I needed to include information about myself and my brother in one variable, I might use the following:
	var family = [{
	    "name" : "Jason",
	    "age" : "24",
	    "gender" : "male"
	},
	{
	    "name" : "Kyle",
	    "age" : "21",
	    "gender" : "male"
	}];
view rawgistfile1.js hosted with   by GitHub
To access this information, we need to access the array index of the person we wish to access. For example, we would use the following snippet to access info stored in family:
	document.write(family[1].name); // Output: Kyle
	document.write(family[0].age); // Output: 24
view rawgistfile1.js hosted with   by GitHub
NOTE: This is beneficial if it will be necessary to loop through stored information, as it lends itself to a for loop with an automatically incrementing value.
Nesting JSON Data
Another way to store multiple people in our variable would be to nest objects. To do this, we would create something similar to the following:
	var family = {
	    "jason" : {
	        "name" : "Jason Lengstorf",
	        "age" : "24",
	        "gender" : "male"
	    },
	    "kyle" : {
	        "name" : "Kyle Lengstorf",
	        "age" : "21",
	        "gender" : "male"
	    }
	}
view rawgistfile1.js hosted with   by GitHub
Accessing information in nested objects is a little easier to understand; to access information in the object, we would use the following snippet:
	document.write(family.jason.name); // Output: Jason Lengstorf
	document.write(family.kyle.age); // Output: 21
	document.write(family.jason.gender); // Output: male
view rawgistfile1.js hosted with   by GitHub
Nested JSON and arrays can be combined as needed to store as much data as necessary.
Why Does JSON Matter?
With the rise of AJAX-powered sites, it’s becoming more and more important for sites to be able to load data quickly and asynchronously, or in the background without delaying page rendering. Switching up the contents of a certain element within our layouts without requiring a page refresh adds a “wow” factor to our applications, not to mention the added convenience for our users. Because of the popularity and ease of social media, many sites rely on the content provided by sites such as Twitter, Flickr, and others. These sites provide RSS feeds, which are easy to import and use on the server-side, but if we try to load them with AJAX, we run into a wall: we can only load an RSS feed if we’re requesting it from the same domain it’s hosted on. An attempt to load my Flickr account’s RSS feed via jQuery’s $.ajax() method results in the following JavaScript error:
	[Exception... "Access to restricted URI denied" code: "1012" 
	nsresult: "0x805303f4 (NS_ERROR_DOM_BAD_URI)" 
	location: "http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3.2/jquery.min.js Line: 19"]
view rawgistfile1.js hosted with   by GitHub
JSON allows us to overcome the cross-domain issue because we can use a method called JSONP that uses a callback function to send the JSON data back to our domain. It’s this capability that makes JSON so incredibly useful, as it opens up a lot of doors that were previously difficult to work around.
How Do We Load JSON into a Project?
One of the easiest ways to load JSON data into our web applications is to use the $.ajax() method available in the jQuery library. The ease of retrieving data will vary based on the site providing the data, but a simple example might look like this:
	$.ajax(
	    type:'GET',
	    url:"http://example.com/users/feeds/",
	    data:"format=json&id=123",
	    success:function(feed) {
	        document.write(feed);
	    },
	    dataType:'jsonp'
	);
view rawgistfile1.js hosted with   by GitHub
This example would request the latest feed items in JSON format and output them to the browser. Obviously, we wouldn’t want to output raw JSON data to the browser, but this example shows the basics of loading JSON from an external source.
A Practical Example: Loading Flickr Streams with JSON and jQuery
[demolink]See the Demo | Download the Source[/demolink]
To show how JSON works in a real-world example, let’s load photos from Flickr using jQuery and the JSON version of Flickr’s “Latest” photo feed.
Step 1: Create the AJAX Request
Flickr’s photostream feeds are relatively easy to access. All users have a unique ID number, which we will send as part of the request to this URL.
	http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne
view rawgistfile1.html hosted with   by GitHub
The request we need to send asks for the latest photos from the user in question, along with flags asking for a JSON-formatted response. The request we need to send will look like this:
	id=XXXXXXXX@NXX&lang=en-us&format=json&jsoncallback=?
view rawgistfile1.html hosted with   by GitHub
In the above example, XXXXXXXX@NXX needs to be replaced with the user’s ID. We’ll be writing a function, so the user’s ID will be passed as an argument called flickrID. Our function will be called loadFlickr(). Let’s create the function that will load our JSON response:
	function loadFlickr(flickrid)
	{
	    $('#feed').html('<span><img src="/blog/images/lightbox-ico-loading.gif" alt=""></span>');
	    $.ajax({
	        type:'GET',
	        url:"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne",
	        data:"id="+flickrid+"&lang=en-us&format=json&jsoncallback=?",
	        success:function(feed) {
	            // Do something with the response
	        },
	        dataType:'jsonp'
	    });
	}
view rawgistfile1.js hosted with   by GitHub
The returned JSON data will look something like this (note that I’ve removed all but one of the returned photos for the sake of brevity):
	({
	    "title": "Uploads from ennuidesign",
	    "link": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/ennuidesign/",

	    }
	 
	    // The rest of the photo entries go here...
	 
	    ]
	})
view rawgistfile1.json hosted with   by GitHub
Step 2: Process the JSON Data
What we’re going to do is display the thumbnails of the latest 16 photos, which will link to the medium-sized display of the image. The Flickr JSON is a little confusing, and it doesn’t provide a direct link to the thumbnail version of our photos, so we’ll have to use some trickery on our end to get to it, which we’ll cover in just a moment. Each photo entry is stored in an array called items, which we access in our AJAX call using feed.items. To get to the data about each entry, we’ll loop through the items until we’ve either hit the last available photo or 16 total photos; whichever comes first. Let’s modify our function and set up the loop:
	function loadFlickr(flickrid)
	{
	    // Display a loading icon in our display element
	    $('#feed').html('<span><img src="/blog/images/lightbox-ico-loading.gif" alt=""></span>');
	 
	    // Request the JSON and process it
	    $.ajax({
	        type:'GET',
	        url:"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne",
	        data:"id="+flickrid+"&lang=en-us&format=json&jsoncallback=?",
	        success:function(feed) {
	            // Create an empty array to store images
	            var thumbs = [];
	 
	            // Loop through the items
	            for(var i=0, l=feed.items.length; i < l && i < 16;   i) 
	            {
	                // Process each image
	            }
	 
	            // Display the thumbnails on the page
	        },
	        dataType:'jsonp'
	    });
	}
view rawgistfile1.js hosted with   by GitHub
The element we’re interested in is the “m” element stored within the “media” element. This can be accessed within our loop using feed.items[i].media.m. We’re going to run a regular expression on this value to get both the medium and thumbnail image paths, which we’ll assemble into a linked thumbnail image. Then, we’ll push the newly assembled HTML into the array of thumbs we created. After we’ve finished the loop, we’ll combine all the images into one string of HTML and replace the contents of our display element with the loaded thumbnails. Let’s add this functionality to our script:
	function loadFlickr(flickrid)
	{
	    // Display a loading icon in our display element
	    $('#feed').html('<span><img src="/blog/images/lightbox-ico-loading.gif" alt=""></span>');
	 
	    // Request the JSON and process it
	    $.ajax({
	        type:'GET',
	        url:"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne",
	        data:"id="+flickrid+"&lang=en-us&format=json&jsoncallback=?",
	        success:function(feed) {
	            // Create an empty array to store images
	            var thumbs = [];
	 
	            // Loop through the items
	            for(var i=0, l=feed.items.length; i < l && i < 16;   i)

Note that I’ve also added a function called addLB() to the end of this function; this adds the lightbox effect to our thumbnails, which is purely for aesthetics.
Step 3: Call Our Function
At this point, we’re ready to call our function. To load my Flickr stream, we would need to call our function as follows:
	loadFlickr("29080075@N02");

The example posted will pull multiple users’ photostreams into the containing box without causing a page refresh. Look at the source code on the demo to see how it was done. NOTE: Keep in mind that this demo was to show how to load JSON data, and not on how to implement the code to call the function. The JavaScript calls are inline, which should NOT be used in a production script.

SharePoint 
sharepoint nedir
SharePoint is a web-based collaborative platform that integrates with Microsoft Office. Launched in 2001, SharePoint is primarily sold as a document management and storage system, but the product is highly configurable and usage varies substantially among organizations.
Microsoft states that SharePoint has 190 million users across 200,000 customer organizations.
There are the Windows SharePoint Services (WSS), the Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) and Microsoft Search Server. Each bring their own functionalities to the table and build upon each other. 
When looking up what SharePoint is, you get a lot of different answers from the Internet:
•	Microsoft SharePoint is a browser-based collaboration and document management platform from Microsoft - Wikipedia
•	Microsoft's content management system. It allows groups to set up a centralized, password protected space for document sharing. Documents can be stored, downloaded and edited, then uploaded for continued sharing. - SAIT Polytechnic Teaching - Glossary
•	SharePoint is a web-based intranet that can help improve your organization's effectiveness by streamlining the management of and access to data. - Creative SharePoint
•	SharePoint is an enterprise information portal, from Microsoft, that can be configured to run Intranet, Extranet and Internet sites. - SharePoint HQ
•	{..} SharePoint is a sort of sharing/blogging/wiki-style server that mainly provides a back end to Microsoft Office - Jack Schofield, Technical Writer Guardian newspaper, UK.
So what is SharePoint? Let's first look at it from a technical perspective. There are the Windows SharePoint Services (WSS), the Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) and Microsoft Search Server. Each bring their own functionality to the table and build upon each other.
Windows SharePoint Services function the basic functionality that Gartner calls Basic Content Services. It offers the user access to Versioning and Check-in/Checkout functionality. WSS can then be extended through the use of the applets to add additional collaborative functions like email alerts, shared calendars, etc.
Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) sits on top of WSS and adds additional features, both to the underlying WSS layer as well as additional ways for the end-user to interact with the repository. The data resides in a SQL Database. Using Webparts it can then present this information to the user using a wide range of different modules and for interaction in different business scenarios. These include such diverse applications as Collaboration, Document management, Records Management (including DOD 5015.2 certified components), Workflow, Personalization, more complex metadata models as well as Blogs and Wikis from the Web 2.0 side.

Difference between readonly and const keyword in C#  	 (GITHUB)
const nedir, readonly nedir  
In C#, a const keyword is used to declare constant fields and constant local. The value of the constant field is the same throughout the program or in other words, once the constant field is assigned the value of this field is not be changed. In C#, constant fields and locals are not variables, a constant is a number, string, null reference, boolean values.

Example:
// C# program to illustrate the 
// use of const keyword 
using System; 
  
class GFG { 
  
    // Constant fields 
    public const int myvar = 10; 
    public const string str = "GeeksforGeeks"; 
  
    // Main method 
    static public void Main() 
    { 
  
        // Display the value of Constant fields 
        Console.WriteLine("The value of myvar: {0}", myvar); 
        Console.WriteLine("The value of str: {0}", str); 
    } 
} 
Output:



The value of myvar: 10
The value of str: GeeksforGeeks
In C#, you can use a readonly keyword to declare a readonly variable. This readonly keyword shows that you can assign the variable only when you declare a variable or in a constructor of the same class in which it is declared.
Example:
filter_none
edit
play_arrow
brightness_4
// C# program to illustrate the use  
// of the readonly keyword 
using System; 
  
class GFG { 
  
    // readonly variables 
    public readonly int myvar1; 
    public readonly int myvar2; 
  
    // Values of the readonly  
    // variables are assigned 
    // Using constructor 
    public GFG(int b, int c) 
    { 
  
        myvar1 = b; 
        myvar2 = c; 
        Console.WriteLine("Display value of myvar1 {0}, "+ 
                        "and myvar2 {1}", myvar1, myvar2); 
    } 
  
    // Main method 
    static public void Main() 
    { 
        GFG obj1 = new GFG(100, 200); 
    } 
} 
Output:
Display value of myvar1 100, and myvar2 200

readonly Modifier

[readonly nedir, readonly modifier nedir, readonly keyword nedir, const nedir]

The readonly modifier prevents a member of a class from being modified after construction. It means that the field declared as readonly can be modified only when you declare it or from within a constructor.

        class Person
        {
            private readonly string name = "John";
            public Person(string name)
            {
                this.name = name;
            }
        }
If we try to modify the name field anywhere else, we will get an error.

There are three major differences between readonly and const fields. 
First, a constant field must be initialized when it is declared, whereas a readonly field can be declared without initialization, as in:

        readonly string name; // OK
        const double PI; // Error
 
Second, a readonly field value can be changed in a constructor, but a constant value cannot.
Third, the readonly field can be assigned a value that is a result of a calculation, but constants cannot, as in:

        readonly double a = Math.Sin(60); // OK
        const double b = Math.Sin(60); // Error

this Keyword	    (GITHUB)

this nedir, this keyword nedir
The this keyword is used inside the class and refers to the current instance of the class, meaning it refers to the current object.
One of the common uses of this is to distinguish class members from other data, such as local or formal parameters of a method, as shown in the following example:
        class Person
        {
            private string name;
            public Person(string name)
            {
                this.name = name; // member of the class
            }
        }

Here, this.name represents the member of the class, whereas name represents the parameter of the constructor.

Another common use of this is for passing the current instance to a method as parameter: ShowPersonInfo(this);

Initialization (GITHUB)
Initialization nedir
Object'in property'lerini objenin creation time'ında Set etmeye yarar. Yani objeyi üretirken property'lerini set etmeye yarayan bir şeydir (neydir? Bir Special Feature'dir [pluralsight]

        public class Employee
        {

        }

        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Employee emp = new Employee(); // null dönmeyecektir.. initialize ettik. Constructor kullandık. Ne olmuş oldu? emp üretilmiş oldu... Hatırlayalım ki constructor kullanıldığı zaman yeni obje (instance) üretilmiş olur.
            Employee emp2; // null dönecektir.

            Console.WriteLine(emp); // hata üretmez
            Console.WriteLine(emp2); // HATA! Might not be initialized before accessing.

            Console.ReadLine();
	}
Initialization MSDN anlatımı:
Local variables in C# must be initialized before they are used. For example, you might declare a local variable without initialization as in the following example:
            int myInt; // Declaration
You cannot use it before you initialize it. You can initialize it using the following statement:
            myInt = new int();  // Initialization // Invoke default constructor for int type.
This statement is equivalent to the following statement:

            myInt = 0;         // Assign an initial value, 0 in this example.  
You can, of course, have the declaration and the initialization in the same statement as in the following examples:
            int myInt = new int(); // declaration and the initialization
–or–
            int myInt = 0; // declaration and the initialization
Using the new operator calls the default constructor of the specific type and assigns the default value to the variable. In the preceding example, the default constructor assigned the value 0 to myInt. For more information about values assigned by calling default constructors, see Default Values Table.
With user-defined types, use new to invoke the default constructor. For example, the following statement invokes the default constructor of the Point struct: 

            Point p = new Point(); // Invoke default constructor for the struct.  

After this call, the struct is considered to be definitely assigned; that is, all its members are initialized to their default values.
Örnek:
  int myInt = new int(); // 0 dönüyor
            int otherInt; // 0 dönüyor //initialize etmediğimiz halde 0 değerini aldı. String'de null değer alabildi. Neden int null alamadı? Cevabı aşağıdaki notta: Reference type value type olayı!
            //int otherInt2 = null; // hata verir. Cannot convert null to int.

            //string myString = new string(); // böyle bir şey yazamazsın. Hata verir.
            string otherString; // null dönüyor
            string otherString2 = null; // null dönüyor

// int is a primitive type and only ReferenceTypes (objects) are nullable.
// not2: An int is a value type. It is really of type Int32. Objects that can be nullable are reference types. At a basic level the difference is that a value type will store the value with the variable where a reference type will store a reference to the value. A reference can be null, meaning that it doesn't point to a value. Where a value type always has a value.
Nullable wraps a value type to allow you to have the option of being null. Using int? is just a compiler shortcut to declare a nullable type.
// not3: int is a value type, which can only hold a value...

ArrayList Class  (GITHUB)
arrayList nedir
Implements the IList interface using an array whose size is dynamically increased as required.
The following example shows how to create and initialize an ArrayList and how to display its values.
using System;
using System.Collections;
public class SamplesArrayList  {

   public static void Main()  {

      // Creates and initializes a new ArrayList.
      ArrayList myAL = new ArrayList();
      myAL.Add("Hello");
      myAL.Add("World");
      myAL.Add("!");

      // Displays the properties and values of the ArrayList.
      Console.WriteLine( "myAL" );
      Console.WriteLine( "    Count:    {0}", myAL.Count );
      Console.WriteLine( "    Capacity: {0}", myAL.Capacity );
      Console.Write( "    Values:" );
      PrintValues( myAL );
   }

   public static void PrintValues( IEnumerable myList )  {
      foreach ( Object obj in myList )
         Console.Write( "   {0}", obj );
      Console.WriteLine();
   }

}


/* 
This code produces output similar to the following:

myAL
    Count:    3
    Capacity: 4
    Values:   Hello   World   !

*/

 Important
We don't recommend that you use the ArrayList class for new development. Instead, we recommend that you use the generic List<T> class. The ArrayList class is designed to hold heterogeneous collections of objects. However, it does not always offer the best performance. Instead, we recommend the following:
•	For a heterogeneous collection of objects, use the List<Object> (in C#) or List(Of Object) (in Visual Basic) type.
•	For a homogeneous collection of objects, use the List<T> class.
See Performance Considerations in the List<T> reference topic for a discussion of the relative performance of these classes. See Non-generic collections shouldn't be used on GitHub for general information on the use of generic instead of non-generic collection types.
The ArrayList is not guaranteed to be sorted. You must sort the ArrayList by calling its Sort method prior to performing operations (such as BinarySearch) that require the ArrayList to be sorted. To maintain a collection that is automatically sorted as new elements are added, you can use the SortedSet<T> class.
The capacity of an ArrayList is the number of elements the ArrayList can hold. As elements are added to an ArrayList, the capacity is automatically increased as required through reallocation. The capacity can be decreased by calling TrimToSize or by setting the Capacity property explicitly.
.NET Framework only: For very large ArrayList objects, you can increase the maximum capacity to 2 billion elements on a 64-bit system by setting the enabled attribute of the <gcAllowVeryLargeObjects> configuration element to true in the run-time environment.
Elements in this collection can be accessed using an integer index. Indexes in this collection are zero-based.
The ArrayList collection accepts null as a valid value. It also allows duplicate elements.
Using multidimensional arrays as elements in an ArrayList collection is not supported.

Strongly Typed
Strongly Typed nedir? Strongly type nedir
C# is a strongly-typed language. It means we must declare the type of a variable which indicates the kind of values it is going to store such as integer, float, decimal, text, etc.
The following declares and initialized variables of different data types.
Example: Variables of Different Data Types

string stringVar = "Hello World!!";
int intVar = 100;
float floatVar = 10.2f;
char charVar = 'A';
bool boolVar = true;
 
In computer programming, programming languages are often colloquially classified as to whether the language's type system makes it strongly typed or weakly typed (loosely typed). Generally, a strongly typed language has stricter typing rules at compile time, which implies that errors and exceptions are more likely to happen during compilation. However, dynamically typed languages (where type checking happens at run time) can also be strongly typed. Most of these rules affect variable assignment, return values and function calling. On the other hand, a weakly typed language has looser typing rules and may produce unpredictable results or may perform implicit type conversion at runtime.[1] A different but related concept is latent typing.

Declarative Programming / Imperative Programming  (GITHUB)

Declarative nedir, imperative nedir, declarative programming nedir, imperative programming nedir

In computer science, declarative programming is a programming paradigm that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.

Declarative programming is when you say what you want, and imperative language is when you say how to get what you want.


İmperative: Emir verebilirsin


Imperative programming, anlaşılacağı üzere Emirli. 

Imperative: NASIL yapacağım diye sorar. Kontrol akışı vardır.

Resmi incele.

Value type olanlar (örneğin int) ---> Stack içinde saklanır.
Pointer'lar da Stack içinde saklanır.
Ama objeler Heap içinde saklanır.

Yani neymiş, örneğin Report report = new Report(); deyince; buradaki report, (YANİ OBJE DEĞİL, POINTER!) -- STACK içinde tutuluyor. AMA report aracılığıyla üretilen yeni OBJE HEAP'TE TUTULUYOR. Güzel bilgi bu… 
Dikkat et… report dediğin şey bir pointer'dir, objenin kendisi değildir. Inıtialize yapıyorsan bu pointer gidip bir OBJE üretecektir. Ama kendisi, yani report, o yeni üretilen objeye işaret eden bir pointer'dir.

Report report2 = report; deyince görüldüğü üzere yeni bir obje üretmedik. Zaten initialization olmadığı belli… new Report(); deyip constructor çalıştırmadık veya bir property'sine bir değer atamadık. Yani yeni bir obje oluşmamış oldu. Yani aynı referansı tutuyor report ile…..

SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) Principles    (GITHUB)
Soa nedir, service oriented architecture nedir
SOA is based on some key principles which are mentioned below
1.	Standardized Service Contract - Services adhere to a service description. A service must have some sort of description which describes what the service is about. This makes it easier for client applications to understand what the service does.
2.	Loose Coupling – (geniş bir yere yayılmış insanlar düşün, yani birbirlerinden uzaklar, birbirlerine bağımlı değiller). Less dependency on each other. This is one of the main characteristics of web services which just states that there should be as less dependency as possible between the web services and the client invoking the web service. So if the service functionality changes at any point in time, it should not break the client application or stop it from working.
3.	Service Abstraction - Services hide the logic they encapsulate from the outside world. The service should not expose how it executes its functionality; it should just tell the client application on what it does and not on how it does it.
4.	Service Reusability - Logic is divided into services with the intent of maximizing reuse. In any development company re-usability is a big topic because obviously one wouldn't want to spend time and effort building the same code again and again across multiple applications which require them. Hence, once the code for a web service is written it should have the ability work with various application types.
5.	Service Autonomy - Services should have control over the logic they encapsulate. The service knows everything on what functionality it offers and hence should also have complete control over the code it contains.
6.	Service Statelessness - Ideally, services should be stateless. This means that services should not withhold information from one state to the other. This would need to be done from either the client application. An example can be an order placed on a shopping site. Now you can have a web service which gives you the price of a particular item. But if the items are added to a shopping cart and the web page navigates to the page where you do the payment, the responsibility of the price of the item to be transferred to the payment page should not be done by the web service. Instead, it needs to be done by the web application.
7.	Service Discoverability - Services can be discovered (usually in a service registry). We have already seen this in the concept of the UDDI, which performs a registry which can hold information about the web service.
8.	Service Composability - Services break big problems into little problems. One should never embed all functionality of an application into one single service but instead, break the service down into modules each with a separate business functionality.
9.	Service Interoperability - Services should use standards that allow diverse subscribers to use the service. In web services, standards as XML and communication over HTTP is used to ensure it conforms to this principle.

Stack
Stack nedir

Stack bir data tipidir; ama abstract bir data tipidir.

In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations:
•	push, which adds an element to the collection, and
•	pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.
 
Örnek:

Stack myStack = new Stack();
myStack.Push("Hello!!");
myStack.Push(null);
myStack.Push(1);
myStack.Push(2);

In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. 

Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.
The term is often used in contrast to declarative programming, which focuses on what the program should accomplish without specifying how the program should achieve the result.

In computer science, declarative programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow. 

Declarative Programming devam: Many languages that apply this style attempt to minimize or eliminate side effects by describing what the program must accomplish in terms of the problem domain, rather than describe how to accomplish it as a sequence of the programming language primitives[2](the how being left up to the language's implementation). This is in contrast with imperative programming, which implements algorithms in explicit steps.

Declarative Query Languages: Definition and Examples (GITHUB)

Some well-known general declarative programming languages include Ruby, R and Haskell. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a declarative query language and is the industry standard for relational databases.
Declarative query nedir, declarative query language nedir
The two main paradigms of database query languages are imperative and declarative. Understanding the difference between these two approaches is essential if you’re going to be successful in database development.

If the query languages were human archetypes, imperative languages would be the micromanaging boss who gives instructions down to the final detail.

In the most basic sense, imperative query languages are used to describe how you want something done specifically. This is accomplished with explicit control in a detailed, step-by step manner; the sequence and wording of each line of code plays a critical role.

Some well-known general imperative programming languages include Python, C and Java.

In the world of graph database technology, there aren’t any purely imperative query languages. However, both Gremlin and the Java API (for Neo4j) include imperative features. These two options provide you with more detailed power over the execution of their task. If written correctly, there are no surprises – you will get exactly what you want done.

However, imperative database query languages can also be limiting and not very user-friendly, requiring an extensive knowledge of the language and deep technical understanding of physical implementation details prior to usage. Writing one part incorrectly creates faulty outcomes.

As a result, imperative languages are more prone to human error. Additionally, users must double-check the environment before and after the query and be prepared to deal with any potential erroneous scenarios.

To better illustrate the differences, imagine you have two children: Isabel and Duncan. Isabel represents an imperative query language and Duncan the declarative query language.

To get the two children to make their beds, you take differing approaches. For Duncan, it is easy. Simply instruct Duncan to make his bed and he will do it however he sees fit. Yet, he might make it differently than you had in mind, especially if you’re a picky parent.

Isabel requires an entirely different process. You must first inform her that she needs both sheets and blankets to make her bed, and that those materials are found on top of her bed. Then she requires step-by-step instructions, such as “spread the sheet over the mattress” and “tuck in the edges.”

The final result will be closely similar to Duncan’s (or perhaps, exactly the same). At the end of the process, both children have their beds made.

Declarative Query Languages: Definition and Examples

All too often, declarative query languages are often defined as being any database query language that is not imperative. However, to define it in such a manner is too broad.

Declarative query languages let users express what data to retrieve, letting the engine underneath take care of seamlessly retrieving it. They function in a more general manner and involve giving broad instructions about what task is to be completed, rather than the specifics on how to complete it. They deal with the results rather than the process, focusing less on the finer details of each task.

Some well-known general declarative programming languages include Ruby, R and Haskell. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a declarative query language and is the industry standard for relational databases.

Using a declarative database query language may also result in better code than what can be created manually, and it is usually easier to understand the purpose of the code written in a declarative language. Declarative query languages are also easier to use as they simply focus on what must be retrieved and do so quickly.

However, declarative languages have their own trade-offs. Users have little to no control over how inputs are dealt with; if there is a bug in the language, the user will have to rely on the providers of the language to fix the problem. Likewise, if the user wants to use a function that the query language doesn’t support, they are often at a loss.

In the previous example of the children, Duncan was able to complete his task in a method faster and easier for his parent than Isabel. However, imagine now that you want to them to wash the dishes.

It is the same process for Isabel: You’d need to walk through each step with her so she can learn how the process works.

For Duncan, however, we have hit a snag. Duncan has never learned how to wash the dishes. You will stay in that impasse with Duncan unless his programming engineers decide to teach him how to wash the dishes. (Duncan isn’t like most children.)

Conclusion

You should select the best query language paradigm for your specific use case. Neither paradigm is better than the other; they each have different strengths for software development.

If your project requires finer accuracy and control, imperative query languages do the job well. If the speed and productivity of the development process matter more, declarative languages offer the flexibility of getting results without as much effort. Ultimately, the choice depends on you.

LINQ  (GITHUB)
Linq nedir
Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) is the name for a set of technologies based on the integration of query capabilities directly into the C# language. Traditionally, queries against data are expressed as simple strings without type checking at compile time or IntelliSense support. Furthermore, you have to learn a different query language for each type of data source: SQL databases, XML documents, various Web services, and so on. With LINQ, a query is a first-class language construct, just like classes, methods, events. You write queries against strongly typed collections of objects by using language keywords and familiar operators. The LINQ family of technologies provides a consistent query experience for objects (LINQ to Objects), relational databases (LINQ to SQL), and XML (LINQ to XML).
For a developer who writes queries, the most visible "language-integrated" part of LINQ is the query expression. Query expressions are written in a declarative query syntax. By using query syntax, you can perform filtering, ordering, and grouping operations on data sources with a minimum of code. You use the same basic query expression patterns to query and transform data in SQL databases, ADO .NET Datasets, XML documents and streams, and .NET collections.
You can write LINQ queries in C# for SQL Server databases, XML documents, ADO.NET Datasets, and any collection of objects that supports IEnumerable or the generic IEnumerable<T> interface. LINQ support is also provided by third parties for many Web services and other database implementations.
The following example shows the complete query operation. The complete operation includes creating a data source, defining the query expression, and executing the query in a foreach statement.
C#Copy
class LINQQueryExpressions
{
    static void Main()
    {
        
        // Specify the data source.
        int[] scores = new int[] { 97, 92, 81, 60 };

        // Define the query expression.
        IEnumerable<int> scoreQuery =
            from score in scores
            where score > 80
            select score;

        // Execute the query.
        foreach (int i in scoreQuery)
        {
            Console.Write(i + " ");
        }            
    }
}
// Output: 97 92 81
The following illustration from Visual Studio shows a partially-completed LINQ query against a SQL Server database in both C# and Visual Basic with full type checking and IntelliSense support:
 
Query expression overview
•	Query expressions can be used to query and to transform data from any LINQ-enabled data source. For example, a single query can retrieve data from a SQL database, and produce an XML stream as output.
•	Query expressions are easy to master because they use many familiar C# language constructs.
•	The variables in a query expression are all strongly typed, although in many cases you do not have to provide the type explicitly because the compiler can infer it. For more information, see Type relationships in LINQ query operations.
•	A query is not executed until you iterate over the query variable, for example, in a foreach statement. For more information, see Introduction to LINQ queries.
•	At compile time, query expressions are converted to Standard Query Operator method calls according to the rules set forth in the C# specification. Any query that can be expressed by using query syntax can also be expressed by using method syntax. However, in most cases query syntax is more readable and concise. For more information, see C# language specification and Standard query operators overview.
•	As a rule when you write LINQ queries, we recommend that you use query syntax whenever possible and method syntax whenever necessary. There is no semantic or performance difference between the two different forms. Query expressions are often more readable than equivalent expressions written in method syntax.
•	Some query operations, such as Count or Max, have no equivalent query expression clause and must therefore be expressed as a method call. Method syntax can be combined with query syntax in various ways. For more information, see Query syntax and method syntax in LINQ.
•	Query expressions can be compiled to expression trees or to delegates, depending on the type that the query is applied to. IEnumerable<T> queries are compiled to delegates. IQueryable and IQueryable<T> queries are compiled to expression trees. For more information, see Expression trees.

Runtime vs Compile time
Runtime nedir, compile time nedir,  run time nedir, compile nedir
Runtime and compile time are programming terms that refer to different stages of software program development. Compile-time is the instance where the code you entered is converted to executable while Run-time is the instance where the executable is running. The terms "runtime" and "compile time" are often used by programmers to refer to different types of errors too.
Compile-time checking occurs during the compile time. Compile time errors are error occurred due to typing mistake, if we do not follow the proper syntax and semantics of any programming language then compile time errors are thrown by the compiler. They wont let your program to execute a single line until you remove all the syntax errors or until you debug the compile time errors. The following are usual compile time errors:
	Syntax errors
	Typechecking errors
	Compiler crashes (Rarely)
Run-time type checking happens during run time of programs. Runtime errors are the errors that are generated when the program is in running state. These types of errors will cause your program to behave unexpectedly or may even kill your program. They are often referred as Exceptions . The following are some usual runtime errors:
	Division by zero
	Dereferencing a null pointer
	Running out of memory

Stateless - Stateful
stateless nedir, stateful nedir
Stateful and stateless are adjectives that describe whether a computer or computer program is designed to note and remember one or more preceding events in a given sequence of interactions with a user, another computer or program, a device, or other outside element. 
Stateful means the computer or program keeps track of the state of interaction, usually by setting values in a storage field designated for that purpose. 
Stateless means there is no record of previous interactions and each interaction request has to be handled based entirely on information that comes with it. 
Stateful and stateless are derived from the usage of state as a set of conditions at a moment in time. (Computers are inherently stateful in operation, so these terms are used in the context of a particular set of interactions, not of how computers work in general.)
The Internet's basic protocol, the Internet Protocol ( IP ), is an example of a stateless interaction. Each packet travels entirely on its own without reference to any other packet. When you request a Web page from a Web site, the request travels in one or more packets, each independent of the other as far as the Internet Protocol program itself is concerned. (The upper layer Transmission Control Protocol - TCP - does relate packets to each other, but uses the information within the packet rather than some external information to do this.) The term connectionless is also used to describe communication in which a connection is made and terminated for each message that is sent. IP is connectionless as well as stateless.
The Web's Hypertext Transfer Protocol ( HTTP ), an application layer above TCP/IP, is also stateless. Each request from a user for a Web page or URL results in the requested pages being served, but without the Web (HTTP) server remembering the request later. In other words, there is no recorded continuity. Each communication is discrete and unrelated to those that precede or follow. In order to have stateful communication, a site developer must furnish a special program that the server can call that can record and retrieve state information. Web browsers such as Netscape Explorer and Microsoft Internet Explorer provide an area in their subdirectories where state information can be stored and accessed. The area and the information that Web browsers and server applications put in this area is called a cookie .
In formal protocol specifications, a finite state machine is an abstract desciption of how a stateful system works that describes the action that follows each possible state.
The Internet (including the World Wide Web) can be thought of as a stateless system or machine. Most computers, human beings, and elephants are stateful.

Query String
Query string nedir, stateless nedir
ÇOK ÖNEMLİ TEXT:
A query string is the portion of a URL where data is passed to a web application and/or back-end database. The reason we need query strings is that the HTTP protocol is stateless by design. For a website to be anything more than a brochure, you need to maintain state (store data). 
There are a number of ways to do this: On most web servers, you can use something like session state server-side. On the client, you can store via cookies. Or in the URL, you can store data via a query string. 

On the world wide web, all URLs can be broken down into the protocol, the location of the file (or program) and the query string. The protocol you see in a browser is almost always HTTP; the location is the typical form of the hostname and filename (for example, www.techopedia.com/somefile.html), and the query string is whatever follows the question mark sign ("?").
For example, in the URL below, the bolded area is the query string that was generated when the term "database" was searched on the Techopedia website.
//www.techopedia.com/search.aspx?q=database§ion=all

IIS- Internet Information Services  (GITHUB)
IIS nedir, iis nedir
Stands for "Internet Information Services." IIS is a web server software package designed for Windows Server. It is used for hosting websites and other content on the Web.
Microsoft’s Internet Information Services provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing websites and the associated users. It provides a visual means of creating, configuring, and publishing sites on the web. The IIS Manager tool allows web administrators to modify website options, such as default pages, error pages, logging settings, security settings, and performance optimizations.
IIS can serve both standard HTML webpages and dynamic webpages, such as ASP.NET applications and PHP pages. When a visitor accesses a page on a static website, IIS simply sends the HTML and associated images to the user’s browser. When a page on a dynamic website is accessed, IIS runs any applications and processes any scripts contained in the page, then sends the resulting data to the user’s browser.
While IIS includes all the features necessary to host a website, it also supports extensions (or “modules”) that add extra functionality to the server. For example, the WinCache Extension enables PHP scripts to run faster by caching PHP processes. The URL Rewrite module allows webmasters to publish pages with friendly URLs that are easier for visitors to type and remember. A streaming extension can be installed to provide streaming media to website visitors.
IIS is a popular option for commercial websites, since it offers many advanced features and is supported by Microsoft. However, it also requires requires a commercial license and the pricing increases depending on the number of users. Therefore, Apache HTTP Server, which is open source and free for unlimited users, remains the most popular web server software.

Internet Information Service (IIS), Microsoft firmasının Windows işletim sistemlerinde ve sunucularında kullandığı, Web servisini sunan alt yazılımdır.

CakePHP 	(GITHUB)
CakePHP is an open-source web framework. It follows the model–view–controller (MVC) approach and is written in PHP, modeled after the concepts of Ruby on Rails, and distributed under the MIT License.

CakePHP uses well-known software engineering concepts and software design patterns, such as convention over configuration, model–view–controller, active record, association data mapping, and front controller.

CakePHP started in April 2005, when a Polish programmer Michal Tatarynowicz[3] wrote a minimal version of a rapid application development framework in PHP, dubbing it Cake.[4][5][6] He published the framework under the MIT license, and opened it up to the online community of developers. In December 2005, L. Masters and G. J. Woodworth founded the Cake Software Foundation to promote development related to CakePHP.[6] Version 1.0 was released in May 2006.

One of the project's inspirations was Ruby on Rails, using many of its concepts. The community has since grown and spawned several sub-projects.

Encapsulation
encapsulation nedir
Encapsulation is implemented by using access specifiers. An access specifier defines the scope and visibility of a class member. C# supports the following access specifiers −
•	Public
•	Private
•	Protected
•	Internal
•	Protected internal

Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. In a different way, encapsulation is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.
•	Technically in encapsulation, the variables or data of a class are hidden from any other class and can be accessed only through any member function of own class in which they are declared.
•	As in encapsulation, the data in a class is hidden from other classes, so it is also known as data-hiding.
•	Encapsulation can be achieved by: Declaring all the variables in the class as private and using C# Properties in the class to set and get the values of variables.
 

using System;
  
public class DemoEncap
{
    // private variables declared 
    // these can only be accessed by public methods of class 
    private String studentName;
    private int studentAge;
 
    // using accessors to get and set the value of studentName 
    public String Name
    {
        get
        {
            return studentName;
        }
 
        set
        {
            studentName = value;
        }
    }
 
    // using accessors to get and set the value of studentAge 
    public int Age
    {
        get
        {
            return studentAge;
        }
 
        set
        {
            studentAge = value;
        }
    }
}
 
// Driver Class 
class GFG
{
 
    // Main Method 
    static public void Main()
    {
 
        // creating object 
        DemoEncap obj = new DemoEncap();
 
        // calls set accessor of the property Name,  
        // and pass "Ankita" as value of the  
        // standard field 'value' 
        obj.Name = "Ankita";
 
        // calls set accessor of the property Age,  
        // and pass "21" as value of the  
        // standard field 'value' 
        obj.Age = 21;
 
        // Displaying values of the variables 
        Console.WriteLine("Name: " + obj.Name);
        Console.WriteLine("Age: " + obj.Age);
    }
}

 
Output:
Name: Ankita
Age: 21
Explanation: In the above program the class DemoEncap is encapsulated as the variables are declared as private. To access these private variables we are using the Name and Age accessors which contains the get and set method to retrieve and set the values of private fields. Accessors are defined as public so that they can access in other class.

Advantages of Encapsulation:
•	Data Hiding: The user will have no idea about the inner implementation of the class. It will not be visible to the user that how the class is stored values in the variables. He only knows that we are passing the values to accessors and variables are getting initialized to that value.
•	Increased Flexibility: We can make the variables of the class as read-only or write-only depending on our requirement. If we wish to make the variables as read-only then we have to only use Get Accessor in the code. If we wish to make the variables as write-only then we have to only use Set Accessor.
•	Reusability: Encapsulation also improves the re-usability and easy to change with new requirements.
•	Testing code is easy: Encapsulated code is easy to test for unit testing.

Result set nedir
An SQL result set is a set of rows from a database, as well as metadata about the query such as the column names, and the types and sizes of each column. Depending on the database system, the number of rows in the result set may or may not be known. Usually, this number is not known up front because the result set is built on-the-fly.

A result set is effectively a table. The ORDER BY clause can be used in a query to impose a certain sort condition on the rows. Without that clause, there is no guarantee whatsoever on the order in which the rows are returned.

MySQL, MsSQL, T-SQL, Oracle, PL-SQL, SQL 	(GITHUB)
MySQL nedir, MsSQL nedir, T-SQL nedir, t sql nedir, tsql nedir, oracle nedir, plsql nedir, pl-sql nedir, pl/sql nedir
MsSQL -> T-SQL
MySQL -> SQL
Oracle --> PL/SQL
https://db-engines.com/en/system/Microsoft+SQL+Server%3BMySQL%3BOracle

MySQL is a database itself that uses SQL language.
PL/SQL is an extension of Structured Query Language (SQL) that is used in Oracle. Oracle is a Database (RDBMS).
Biz T-SQL üzerinden çalışıyoruz (MSSQL'de), peki MySQL nedir?
MySQL is an open source SQL database, which is developed by a Swedish company – MySQL AB. MySQL is pronounced as "my ess-que-ell," in contrast with SQL, pronounced "sequel."
MySQL is supporting many different platforms including Microsoft Windows, the major Linux distributions, UNIX, and Mac OS X.
MySQL has free and paid versions, depending on its usage (non-commercial/commercial) and features. MySQL comes with a very fast, multi-threaded, multi-user and robust SQL database server.
PL/SQL vs MySQL
DESCRIPTION- in one sentence we can actually find the major differnce btw them, see plsql is basically a DATABASE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE that is used in ORACLE DATABASE.
1.	and MYSQL is itself is database which that uses SQL programming language and SQL is just a ANSI standard, and is used as a base with most Database systems, like Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, IBM DB2 have used this as a base and extended/enhanced in their database systems.

SQL vs MySQL
KEY DIFFERENCE:
•	SQL is a language which is used to operate your database whereas MySQL was one of the first open-source database available in the market
•	SQL is used in the accessing, updating, and manipulation of data in a database while MySQL is an RDBMS that allows keeping the data that exists in a database organized
•	SQL is a Structured Query Language and MySQL is a RDBMS to store, retrieve, modify and administrate a database.
•	SQL is a query language while MYSQL is a database software

MS SQL 
MsSQL Server is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft Inc. Its primary query languages are − T-SQL, ANSI SQL

Oracle
It is a very large multi-user based database management system. Oracle is a relational database management system developed by 'Oracle Corporation'.

Oracle works to efficiently manage its resources, a database of information among the multiple clients requesting and sending data in the network.
It is an excellent database server choice for client/server computing. Oracle supports all major operating systems for both clients and servers, including MSDOS, NetWare, UnixWare, OS/2 and most UNIX flavors.
PL/SQL is an Oracle's procedural language extension to SQL. It is a server-side, stored procedural language that is easy-to-use, seamless with SQL, portable, and secure. PL/SQL enables you to mix SQL statements with procedural constructs.

Oracle ile MYSQL arasındaki farklar üzerine:
SQL is a database language used with Oracle Database.
MySQL is a database itself that uses SQL language.
The difference is that MySQL is free, and the world's most popular database, and Oracle isn't free (except with trials and certain products) and makes billions from selling premium database software to large enterprises and SME.

There are many more differences between Oracle and MySQL.We can summarise them as follows-
1.Oracle is way more powerful than MySQL
2.Oracle supports distributed databases while MySQL doesn’t
3.Oracle supports save points while MySQL doesn’t
4.Oracle allows programs within the database while MySQL doesn’t
5.Oracle is suited for enterprise deployments while MySQL is suited for small to medium scale
6.Oracle requires that you pay a licensing fee while MySQL doesn’t

-- Daha anlamlı bir açıklama:

This might be a slightly controversial view ( and this is all in my opinion).
   
I have been a Developer for most of my career and I have used an old hierarchical DB, called HP Image 3000, Oracle, MS SQL and MySQL.
IMO, there is a lot of snobbery around Oracle. Its very good, but very expensive and in my opinion largely unnecessary and over used.
When you consider how many large companies and applications use MySQL without any issue, it will cope with 90% of demand. Hardware is so powerful now and the original concerns about performance are largely negated by the raw power of the hardware. Oracle should be a niche market and not a large player, as it really isn’t needed.
I worked for a large American company who used Oracle, I asked why, they said because its the best, I persisted and said what do you mean, they had no answer.
MySQL will be fine for most things and as its free, why not use that. The advent of cloud computing and the pricing model of many data centers, makes licencing very expensive (virtual CPU’s cores) for both Oracle and MS SQL.
Facebook, Uber and Google, used/use MySQL, so the idea its not scalable, is a bit ridiculous.
What is sad and I really mean it, is that the traditional IT Operations and the DBA role in IT, will slowly disappear, as its not really needed unless in some extreme situations.
-- Diğer açıklama:

Oracle is a Database tool that uses PL/SQL language.
MySQL is a also a Database tool itself that uses SQL language.

	What is PL/SQL?
Pl-sql nedir plsql nedir pl/sql nedir
PL/SQL is an extension of Structured Query Language (SQL) that is used in Oracle. Unlike SQL, PL/SQL allows the programmer to write code in a procedural format. Full form of PL/SQL is "Procedural Language extensions to SQL".
It combines the data manipulation power of SQL with the processing power of procedural language to create super powerful SQL queries.
PL/SQL means instructing the compiler 'what to do' through SQL and 'how to do' through its procedural way.
Similar to other database languages, it gives more control to the programmers by the use of loops, conditions and object-oriented concepts.

NoSQL	(GITHUB)
Nosql nedir
https://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/06/top-nosql-database-engines.html
İlişkisiz veritabanıdır. NoSQL is not a relational database.
Bir NoSQL veritabanında, kayıtlar genellikle bir JSON belgesi olarak saklanır.
Why NoSQL? It's high performance with high availability, and offers rich query language and easy scalability.

NoSQL (ilişkisel olmayan) Veritabanları Nasıl Çalışır?
NoSQL veritabanları, verilere erişmek ve verileri yönetmek için belge, grafik, anahtar-değer, bellek içi ve arama dahil olmak üzere çeşitli veri modelleri kullanır. Bu tür veritabanları, özellikle büyük veri hacmi, düşük gecikme süresi ve esnek veri modelleri gerektiren uygulamalar için optimize edilmiştir. Bu gereksinimler, diğer veritabanlarının veri tutarlılığı kısıtlamalarının bir kısmı esnetilerek karşılanır.
NoSQL is a whole new way of thinking about a database. NoSQL is not a relational database. The reality is that a relational database model may not be the best solution for all situations. The easiest way to think of NoSQL, is that of a database which does not adhering to the traditional relational database management system (RDMS) structure. Sometimes you will also see it revered to as 'not only SQL'.

Imagine that you have coupons that you wanted to push to mobile customers that purchase a specific item. This is a customer facing system of engagement requires location data, purchase data, wallet data, and so on. You want to engage the mobile customer in real-time.

What you require is a very agile delivery system that is easily able to processes unstructured data. The system of engagement would need to be extremely dynamic. 

Basit bir kitap veritabanının şemasını modelleme örneğini ele alalım:
•	İlişkisel bir veritabanında genellikle bir kitap kaydı gizlenerek (veya “normalleştirilerek”) ayrı tablolarda depolanırken, ilişkiler birincil ve yabancı anahtar kısıtlamaları tarafından tanımlanır. Bu örnekte Books (Kitaplar) tablosu ISBN, Book Title (Kitap Başlığı) ve Edition Number (Baskı Sayısı) sütunlarına; Authors (Yazarlar) tablosu AuthorID (Yazar Kimliği) ve Author Name (Yazar Adı) sütunlarına; Author-ISBN (Yazar-ISBN) tablosu ise AuthorID (Yazar Kimliği) ve ISBN sütunlarına sahiptir. İlişkisel model, veritabanının yedekliliği azaltacak şekilde normalleştirilmiş ve genel olarak depolama için optimize edilmiş tablolar arasında başvurusal bütünlük uygulamasına imkan tanıyacak şekilde tasarlanmıştır.
•	Bir NoSQL veritabanında, kitap kaydı genellikle bir JSON belgesi olarak saklanır. Her kitap için öğe, ISBN, Book Title (Kitap Başlığı), Edition Number (Baskı Sayısı), Author Name (Yazar Adı) ve AuthorID (Yazar Kimliği) bilgileri tek bir belgede öznitelikler olarak depolanır. Bu modelde, veriler sezgisel yazılım geliştirme ve yatay ölçeklenebilirlik için optimize edilir.

Neden NoSQL veritabanı kullanmalısınız?
NoSQL veritabanları, harika kullanıcı deneyimleri sunulması amacıyla esnek, ölçeklenebilir, yüksek performanslı ve yüksek oranda işlevsel veritabanları gerektiren mobil, web ve oyun gibi birçok modern uygulama için idealdir.
•	Esneklik: NoSQL genellikle daha hızlı ve daha fazla yinelemeli yazılım geliştirmeyi mümkün kılan esnek şemalar sağlar. Esnek veri modeli sayesinde NoSQL veritabanları yarı yapılandırılmış ve yapılandırılmamış veriler için idealdir.
•	Ölçeklenebilirlik: NoSQL veritabanları genellikle pahalı ve kalıcı sunucular eklenerek ölçeği artırılabilecek şekilde değil, dağıtılmış donanım kümeleri kullanılarak ölçeği genişletilebilecek şekilde tasarlanır. Bazı bulut sağlayıcıları bu işlemleri arka planda, tam olarak yönetilen bir hizmet olarak gerçekleştirir.
•	Yüksek performans: NoSQL veritabanları, benzer işlevlerin ilişkisel veritabanlarıyla gerçekleştirilmesi ile karşılaştırıldığında daha yüksek performansı mümkün kılan belirli veri modelleri (belge, anahtar-değer, grafik gibi) ve erişim desenleri için optimize edilmiştir.
•	Yüksek oranda işlevsel: NoSQL veritabanları, her biri ilgili veri modeli için özel olarak tasarlanmış yüksek oranda işlevsel API'ler ve veri türleri sağlar.

Redis (Remote Dictionary Server)	   (GITHUB)
Redis nedir
Redis, bir milisaniyenin altında yanıt süreleri sunan, açık kaynak kodlu bir bellek içi veri deposudur. 
Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes with radius queries and streams. Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.

Redis (/ˈrɛdɪs/; Remote Dictionary Server) is an in-memory data structure project implementing a distributed, in-memory key-value database with optional durability. Redis supports different kinds of abstract data structures, such as strings, lists, maps, sets, sorted sets, HyperLogLogs, bitmaps, streams, and spatial indexes. The project is mainly developed by Salvatore Sanfilippo and as of 2019, is sponsored by Redis Labs.[8] It is open-source software released under a BSD 3-clause license.

History
The name Redis means REmote DIctionary Server.[6] The Redis project began when Salvatore Sanfilippo, nicknamed antirez, the original developer of Redis, was trying to improve the scalability of his Italian startup, developing a real-time web log analyzer. After encountering significant problems in scaling some types of workloads using traditional database systems, Sanfilippo began to prototype a first proof of concept version of Redis in Tcl.[9] Later Sanfilippo translated that prototype to the C language and implemented the first data type, the list. After a few weeks of using the project internally with success, Sanfilippo decided to open source it, announcing the project on Hacker News. The project began to get traction, more so among the Ruby community, with GitHub and Instagram being among the first companies adopting it.

Difference between scaling horizontally and vertically for databases		(GITHUB)

Horizontal scaling nedir, vertical scaling nedir

Horizontal scaling means that you scale by adding more machines into your pool of resources whereas Vertical scaling means that you scale by adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine.
An easy way to remember this is to think of a machine on a server rack, we add more machines across the horizontal direction and add more resources to a machine in the vertical direction.
                   
In a database world horizontal-scaling is often based on the partitioning of the data i.e. each node contains only part of the data, in vertical-scaling the data resides on a single node and scaling is done through multi-core i.e. spreading the load between the CPU and RAM resources of that machine.
With horizontal-scaling it is often easier to scale dynamically by adding more machines into the existing pool - Vertical-scaling is often limited to the capacity of a single machine, scaling beyond that capacity often involves downtime and comes with an upper limit.
Good examples of horizontal scaling are Cassandra, MongoDB, Google Cloud Spanner .. and a good example of vertical scaling is MySQL - Amazon RDS (The cloud version of MySQL). It provides an easy way to scale vertically by switching from small to bigger machines. This process often involves downtime.
In-Memory Data Grids such as GigaSpaces XAP, Coherence etc.. are often optimized for both horizontal and vertical scaling simply because they're not bound to disk. Horizontal-scaling through partitioning and vertical-scaling through multi-core support.

Distributed database / DDBMS
Distributed database nedir? DDBMS nedir (distributed database management system)
A distributed database is a database that consists of two or more files located in different sites either on the same network or on entirely different networks. Portions of the database are stored in multiple physical locations and processing is distributed among multiple database nodes.
Önemli notlar: 
Distributed databases are capable of modular development, meaning that systems can be expanded by adding new computers and local data to the new site and connecting them to the distributed system without interruption.
When failures occur in centralized databases, the system comes to a complete stop. When a component fails in distributed database systems, however, the system will continue to function at reduced performance until the error is fixed.
Admins can achieve lower communication costs for distributed database systems if the data is located close to where it is used the most. This is not possible in centralized systems.
-not bitiş
Kısa açıklama:
A distributed database is a database in which not all storage devices are attached to a common processor.[1] It may be stored in multiple computers, located in the same physical location; or may be dispersed over a network of interconnected computers. Unlike parallel systems, in which the processors are tightly coupled and constitute a single database system, a distributed database system consists of loosely coupled sites that share no physical components.

A centralized distributed database management system (DDBMS) integrates data logically so it can be managed as if it were all stored in the same location. The DDBMS synchronizes all the data periodically and ensures that data updates and deletes performed at one location will be automatically reflected in the data stored elsewhere.
By contrast, a centralized database consists of a single database file located at one site using a single network.
When in a collection, distributed databases are logically interrelated with each other, and they often represent a single logical database. With distributed databases, data is physically stored across multiple sites and independently managed. The processors on each site are connected by a network, and they don't have any multiprocessing configuration.
A common misconception is that a distributed database is a loosely connected file system. In reality, it's much more complicated than that. Distributed databases incorporate transaction processing, but are not synonymous with transaction processing systems.
In general, distributed databases include the following features:
•	Location independent
•	Distributed query processing
•	Distributed transaction management
•	Hardware independent
•	Operating system independent
•	Network independent
•	Transaction transparency
•	DBMS independent
Distributed database architecture
(homogenous distributed database system nedir, heterogeneous distributed database nedir)
Distributed databases can be homogenous or heterogeneous.
In a homogenous distributed database system, all the physical locations have the same underlying hardware and run the same operating systems and database applications. Homogenous distributed database systems appear to the user as a single system, and they can be much easier to design and manage. For a distributed database system to be homogenous, the data structures at each location must be either identical or compatible. The database application used at each location must also be either identical or compatible.

Features of a distributed database
In a heterogeneous distributed database, the hardware, operating systems or database applications may be different at each location. Different sites may use different schemas and software, although a difference in schema can make query and transaction processing difficult.
Different nodes may have different hardware, software and data structure, or they may be in locations that are not compatible. Users at one location may be able to read data at another location but not upload or alter it. Heterogeneous distributed databases are often difficult to use, making them economically infeasible for many businesses.
Types of distributed databases
Replicated data is used to create instances of data in different parts of the database. By using replicated data, distributed databases can access identical data locally, thus avoiding traffic. Replicated data can be divided into two categories: read-only and writable data.
Read-only versions of replicated data allow revisions only to the first instance; subsequent enterprise data replications are then adjusted. Writable data can be altered, but the first instance is immediately changed.
Horizontally fragmented data involves the use of primary keys that refer to one record in the database. Horizontal fragmentation is usually reserved for situations in which business locations only need to access the database pertaining to their specific branch.
Vertically fragmented data involves using copies of primary keys that are available within each section of the database and are accessible to each branch. Vertically fragmented data is utilized when the branch of a business and the central location interact with the same accounts in different ways.

Database Management System - DBMS
Dbms nedir
DBMS: The software which is used to manage database is called Database Management System (DBMS). For Example, MySQL, Oracle etc. are popular commercial DBMS used in different applications. DBMS allows users the following tasks:
Data Definition: It helps in creation, modification and removal of definitions that define the organization of data in database.
Data Updation: It helps in insertion, modification and deletion of the actual data in the database.
Data Retrieval: It helps in retrieval of data from the database which can be used by applications for various purposes.
User Administration: It helps in registering and monitoring users, enforcing data security, monitoring performance, maintaining data integrity, dealing with concurrency control and recovering information corrupted by unexpected failure.
Introduction of DBMS (Database Management System) | Set 1
Important Terminology

Database: Database is a collection of inter-related data which helps in efficient retrieval, insertion and deletion of data from database and organizes the data in the form of tables, views, schemas, reports etc. For Example, university database organizes the data about students, faculty, and admin staff etc. which helps in efficient retrieval, insertion and deletion of data from it.

DDL is short name of Data Definition Language, which deals with database schemas and descriptions, of how the data should reside in the database.

CREATE: to create a database and its objects like (table, index, views, store procedure, function, and triggers)
ALTER: alters the structure of the existing database
DROP: delete objects from the database
(truncate nedir)
TRUNCATE: remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed
COMMENT: add comments to the data dictionary
RENAME: rename an object
DML is short name of Data Manipulation Language which deals with data manipulation and includes most common SQL statements such SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc., and it is used to store, modify, retrieve, delete and update data in a database.

SELECT: retrieve data from a database
INSERT: insert data into a table
UPDATE: updates existing data within a table
DELETE: Delete all records from a database table
MERGE: UPSERT operation (insert or update)
CALL: call a PL/SQL or Java subprogram
EXPLAIN PLAN: interpretation of the data access path
LOCK TABLE: concurrency Control
Database Management System: The software which is used to manage database is called Database Management System (DBMS). For Example, MySQL, Oracle etc. are popular commercial DBMS used in different applications. DBMS allows users the following tasks:

Data Definition: It helps in creation, modification and removal of definitions that define the organization of data in database.

Data Updation: It helps in insertion, modification and deletion of the actual data in the database.

Data Retrieval: It helps in retrieval of data from the database which can be used by applications for various purposes.

User Administration: It helps in registering and monitoring users, enforcing data security, monitoring performance, maintaining data integrity, dealing with concurrency control and recovering information corrupted by unexpected failure.

Paradigm Shift from File System to DBMS

 File System manages data using files in hard disk. Users are allowed to create, delete, and update the files according to their requirement. Let us consider the example of file based University Management System. Data of students is available to their respective Departments, Academics Section, Result Section, Accounts Section, Hostel Office etc. Some of the data is common for all sections like Roll No, Name, Father Name, Address and Phone number of students but some data is available to a particular section only like Hostel allotment number which is a part of hostel office. Let us discuss the issues with this system:

Redundancy of data: Data is said to be redundant if same data is copied at many places. If a student wants to change Phone number, he has to get it updated at various sections. Similarly, old records must be deleted from all sections representing that student.
Inconsistency of Data: Data is said to be inconsistent if multiple copies of same data does not match with each other. If Phone number is different in Accounts Section and Academics Section, it will be inconsistent. Inconsistency may be because of typing errors or not updating all copies of same data.
Difficult Data Access: A user should know the exact location of file to access data, so the process is very cumbersome and tedious. If user wants to search student hostel allotment number of a student from 10000 unsorted students’ records, how difficult it can be.
Unauthorized Access: File System may lead to unauthorized access to data. If a student gets access to file having his marks, he can change it in unauthorized way.
No Concurrent Access: The access of same data by multiple users at same time is known as concurrency. File system does not allow concurrency as data can be accessed by only one user at a time.
No Backup and Recovery: File system does not incorporate any backup and recovery of data if a file is lost or corrupted.
These are the main reasons which made a shift from file system to DBMS.

Access Modifier = Access Specifier = Erişim Modifiyeri)                               	 (GITHUB)
Access modifier nedir, public nedir, private nedir, protected nedir, internal nedir, access specifier nedir, access modifier nedir
Access specifier de denir, access modifier de denir. Kaynaklar incelendi: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/What-are-the-different-access-specifiers-in-Chash-NET
All types and type members have an accessibility level, which controls whether they can be used from other code in your assembly or other assemblies. You can use the following access modifiers to specify the accessibility of a type or member when you declare it:
public

The type or member can be accessed by any other code in the same assembly or another assembly that references it.
private

The type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class or struct.
protected

The type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class, or in a class that is derived from that class. (class dışından erişemezsin)

internal

The type or member can be accessed by any code in the same assembly, but not from another assembly.
protected internal 

The type or member can be accessed by any code in the assembly in which it is declared, or from within a derived class in another assembly.
private protected 

The type or member can be accessed only within its declaring assembly, by code in the same class or in a type that is derived from that class.
The following examples demonstrate how to specify access modifiers on a type and member:
public class Bicycle
{
    public void Pedal() { }
}
Not all access modifiers can be used by all types or members in all contexts, and in some cases the accessibility of a type member is constrained by the accessibility of its containing type. The following sections provide more details about accessibility.
Class and Struct Accessibility
Classes and structs that are declared directly within a namespace (in other words, that are not nested within other classes or structs) can be either public or internal. Internal is the default if no access modifier is specified.
Struct members, including nested classes and structs, can be declared as public, internal, or private. Class members, including nested classes and structs, can be public, protected internal, protected, internal, private protected or private. The access level for class members and struct members, including nested classes and structs, is private by default. Private nested types are not accessible from outside the containing type.
Derived classes cannot have greater accessibility than their base types. In other words, you cannot have a public class B that derives from an internal class A. If this were allowed, it would have the effect of making A public, because all protected or internal members of A are accessible from the derived class.
You can enable specific other assemblies to access your internal types by using the InternalsVisibleToAttribute. For more information, see Friend Assemblies.

Nested Classes
Nested class nedir, nested classes nedir
When one class is entirely dependent upon another, you may decide to implement it using a nested class. Nested classes are declared within the scope of an existing class and receive special benefits when they access their parent class's members.


What are Nested Classes?
A nested class is a special type of class that can be created using C#. Normally classes are declared within a namespace, or in the default namespace if one is not specified. A nested class is defined within the code block of another class, which itself may be a nested class to permit multiple nesting levels.


A nested class generally behaves is the same way as any other class. It can be instantiated separately to its parent class and is not instantiated automatically by its parent. However, there are some important differences. One key difference concerns the scope of the class. Normally classes can be either public or internal. A nested class may be declared as private, meaning that the class can only be seen by its parent class and other nested classes within that parent. A nested class may also be declared as protected, allowing it to also be accessed by classes that derive from its parent type. This may be extended to protected internal to allow other classes in the same assembly to access it.

Nested classes are given special access to instances of their parent classes. When an object of a parent class is passed to a method of a nested class, the method is permitted to access the private and protected members of the object. This makes nested classes ideal where a special relationship exists with the parent class that requires access to private members, particularly when the nested class is not required anywhere else and is never used in a standalone capability.

Example Nested Classes
We will start with a simple example of a nested class. In this case, the outer class will describe a sales order in an order-processing system. In this rather contrived design, there is no requirement for an order line to ever be created without an order. Furthermore, there is no need for an order line to be used externally to an order. In this case, it is useful to create an Order class with a nested, private OrderLine class.
NB: The following code uses .NET 3.0 syntax for brevity. For earlier versions of the .NET framework, you will need to expand the property declarations and possibly remove the use of generics.


class Order
{
    private List<OrderLine> _orderLines = new List<OrderLine>();
 
    public void AddOrderLine(string product, int quantity, double price)
    {
        OrderLine line = new OrderLine();
        line.ProductName = product;
        line.Quantity = quantity;
        line.Price = price;
        _orderLines.Add(line);
    }
 
    public double OrderTotal()
    {
        double total = 0;
        foreach (OrderLine line in _orderLines)
        {
            total += line.OrderLineTotal();
        }
        return total;
    }
 
    // Nested class
    private class OrderLine
    {
        public string ProductName { get; set; }
        public int Quantity { get; set; }
        public double Price { get; set; }
 
        public double OrderLineTotal()
        {
            return Price * Quantity;
        }
    }
}
The code above shows the simplified Order and nested OrderLine classes. The Order class has two public members. The first allows an item to be added to a private collection of order lines. The product name, price and quantity are passed to this method, which builds an OrderLine object and adds it to the list. The second method loops through each item in the collection and calculates the total value for the order.
The nested OrderLine class is used to represent order lines. It includes properties for the product name, quantity and price and a single method that calculates the total price for the order line. As the class is marked as private, it is invisible to all classes except its parent and any other nested classes that we may later create within Order. We could change the access modifier for the nested class to protected if we wished it to be visible to classes that inherit from Order.
We can test the order mechanism with the following code. This creates an order with two order lines and outputs the total value to the console:
Order order = new Order();
order.AddOrderLine("Cheese", 5, 1.99);
order.AddOrderLine("Oranges", 12, 0.35);
Console.WriteLine(order.OrderTotal());  // Outputs "14.15"
Increasing Nested Class Visibility
As our ordering system evolves, we may decide that it would be useful to permit other classes access to the nested OrderLine class. We could then modify the AddOrderLine method to accept an OrderLine object rather than its constituent parts. We can do this by changing the access modifier of the nested class to internal, protected internal or public, depending upon the requirements. The following code shows a new version of the code:

class Order
{
    private List<OrderLine> _orderLines = new List<OrderLine>();
 
    public void AddOrderLine(OrderLine line)
    {
        _orderLines.Add(line);
    }
 
    public double OrderTotal()
    {
        double total = 0;
        foreach (OrderLine line in _orderLines)
        {
            total += line.OrderLineTotal();
        }
        return total;
    }
 
    // Nested class
    internal class OrderLine
    {
        public string ProductName { get; set; }
        public int Quantity { get; set; }
        public double Price { get; set; }
 
        public double OrderLineTotal()
        {
            return Price * Quantity;
        }
    }
}


With the new versions of the classes, the code that creates an order will also be different. Rather than passing the product details as separate variables, the calling class will instantiate order lines and pass these to the AddOrderLine method. When instantiating a nested class, the name of the class must be qualified by prefixing it with the parent class's name, as in the following, updated example. Note that the order lines are created as Order.OrderLine objects.

Order order = new Order();
 
Order.OrderLine line1 = new Order.OrderLine(); //vaaay olaya gel

line1.ProductName = "Cheese";
line1.Quantity = 5;
line1.Price = 1.99;
order.AddOrderLine(line1);
 
Order.OrderLine line2 = new Order.OrderLine();
line2.ProductName = "Oranges";
line2.Quantity = 12;
line2.Price = 0.35;
order.AddOrderLine(line2);
 
Console.WriteLine(order.OrderTotal());


Accessing Private Members of the Parent Class
The final example will demonstrate the ability for nested classes to access private members of their parent classes. In this example, we have modified the order to include a discount multiplier. The multiplier is held as a private variable that may have been initialised using a constructor or a property. In this case the value is fixed at 0.85. Every order line value will be multiplied by this amount to give a 15% discount.
To allow the order lines to access the discount multiplier, the OrderLineTotal method has been updated to include a parameter. This parameter accepts an Order object. The method retrieves the private discount multiplier from the Order and includes it in the calculation, rounding the result to two decimal places on a line-by-line basis. If the OrderLine class was not nested within Order, this would not be possible.

class Order
{
    private List<OrderLine> _orderLines = new List<OrderLine>();
    private double DiscountMultiplier = 0.85;
 
    public void AddOrderLine(OrderLine line)
    {
        _orderLines.Add(line);
    }
 
    public double OrderTotal()
    {
        double total = 0;
        foreach (OrderLine line in _orderLines)
        {
            total += line.OrderLineTotal(this);
        }
        return total;
    }
 
    // Nested class
    internal class OrderLine
    {
        public string ProductName { get; set; }
        public int Quantity { get; set; }
        public double Price { get; set; }
 
        public double OrderLineTotal(Order order)
        {
            return Math.Round(Price * Quantity * order.DiscountMultiplier, 2);
        }
    }
}

NB: Although nested classes can access the private members of their parent class, the reverse is not true. Private members of nested classes are invisible to their parent class.

Class nedir
Class'lar ile ilgili önemli bilgiler:

namespace ConsoleApp6
{
    public class PublicClass
    {
    }
 
    internal class InternalClass
    {
    }
 
    // access modifier'siz class'lar otomaitik olarak internal olurlar.
 
    class AccessModifiersizClass
    {
    }
 
 
    // Aşağıdaki hata verir. Direkt olarak namespace içine yazılmış olan class'lar sadece public veya internal olabilir!
    // Classes and structs that are declared directly within a namespace (in other words, that are not nested within other classes or structs) can be either public or internal. Internal is the default if no access modifier is specified.
    /*
    private class PrivateClass

SQL
SQL nedir
In 1970's the product called 'SEQUEL', structured English query language, developed by IBM and later SEQUEL was renamed to 'SQL' which stands for Structured Query Language.
In 1986, SQL was approved by ANSI (American national Standards Institute) and in 1987, it was approved by ISO (International Standards Organization).
SQL is a structure query language which is a common database language for all RDBMS products. Different RDBMS product vendors have developed their own database language by extending SQL for their own RDBMS products.
T-SQL stands for Transact Structure Query Language which is a Microsoft product and is an extension of SQL Language. Example:
MS SQL Server --> SQL\T-SQL
ORACLE        --> SQL\PL-SQL

derive, derivation, inherit, inheritance kelimeleri
Derive nedir, derivation nedir, inherit nedir, inheritance nedir, derive from nedir, inherit from nedir
Kelimelerin nasıl kullanılabileceğiyle ilgili bilgi içerir:
	Derive
A class can be derived from more than one class or interface 
(derive meaning: obtain something from (a specified source)).

Definition - What does Derived Class mean?
A derived class is a class created or derived from another existing class. The existing class from which the derived class is created through the process of inheritance is known as a base class or superclass.

class <derived_class> : <base_class> 
{
}
	Inherit
Definition - What does Inherited Class mean?
An inherited class is called a subclass of its parent class or super class.
class B inherits from class A: 
class B : A {}
(inherit meaning: derive (a quality, characteristic, or predisposition) genetically from one's parents or ancestors.)
Örnek cümle: The child classes inherit methods and properties of the parent class

sealed 
Sealed nedir
Sealed bir access modifier değildir! Evet, bir modifier'dir. Ama access modifier değildir. Çünkü access'i yani erişimi değiştirmez, yani erişimi modifiye etmez.
Peki sealed tanımda ne olarak geçer?
Sealed bir modifier'dir.
Sealed daha genel anlamda bakıldığında bir keyword'dür tabi ki: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/
Sealed'in neden bir access modifier olmadığına dair güzel bir cevap: Cause if you cannot derive from a class it doesn't mean you cannot access it.
When applied to a class, the sealed modifier prevents other classes from inheriting from it. In the following example, class B inherits from class A, but no class can inherit from class B.
class A {}
sealed class B : A {}
Önemli: You can also use the sealed modifier on a method or property that overrides a virtual method or property in a base class. This enables you to allow classes to derive from your class and prevent them from overriding specific virtual methods or properties.
Example (gayet açık)
In the following example, Z inherits from Y but Z cannot override the virtual function F that is declared in X and sealed in Y.
C#Copy
class X
{
    protected virtual void F() { Console.WriteLine("X.F"); }
    protected virtual void F2() { Console.WriteLine("X.F2"); }
}

class Y : X
{
    sealed protected override void F() { Console.WriteLine("Y.F"); }
    protected override void F2() { Console.WriteLine("Y.F2"); }
}

class Z : Y
{
    // Attempting to override F causes compiler error CS0239.
    // protected override void F() { Console.WriteLine("Z.F"); }

    // Overriding F2 is allowed.
    protected override void F2() { Console.WriteLine("Z.F2"); }
}
When you define new methods or properties in a class, you can prevent deriving classes from overriding them by not declaring them as virtual.
It is an error to use the abstract modifier with a sealed class, because an abstract class must be inherited by a class that provides an implementation of the abstract methods or properties.
When applied to a method or property, the sealed modifier must always be used with override.
Because structs are implicitly sealed, they cannot be inherited.
For more information, see Inheritance.
For more examples, see Abstract and Sealed Classes and Class Members.
Example
sealed class SealedClass
{
    public int x;
    public int y;
}

class SealedTest2
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var sc = new SealedClass();
        sc.x = 110;
        sc.y = 150;
        Console.WriteLine($"x = {sc.x}, y = {sc.y}");
    }
}
// Output: x = 110, y = 150
In the previous example, you might try to inherit from the sealed class by using the following statement:
class MyDerivedC: SealedClass{} // Error
The result is an error message:
'MyDerivedC': cannot derive from sealed type 'SealedClass'
Remarks
To determine whether to seal a class, method, or property, you should generally consider the following two points:
•	The potential benefits that deriving classes might gain through the ability to customize your class.
•	The potential that deriving classes could modify your classes in such a way that they would no longer work correctly or as expected.

Dataset
DataSet: This is a collection of DataTables. We use the DataSet type to store many DataTables in a single collection. Conceptually, the DataSet acts as a set of DataTable instances. 
Usage: DataSet simplifies programs that use many DataTables. To effectively use the DataSet, you will need to have some DataTables handy. We begin by creating some. 
Create: In this program, we create two DataTables. One stores two rows of patient information. And the second stores two rows of medication information. 
Next: We create a DataSet with the DataSet constructor. Then we add the two DataTables to the DataSet instance. Finally we print the XML. 
DataSetName: Every DataSet can have a name specified. Usually, it is easiest to specify this inside the DataSet constructor. But you don't always know the name at this time. 
However: You can also change the name by assigning to the DataSetName property. You can also read the DataSetName property. 
Copy, Clear: DataSet has a Clear method that clears all the DataTables in the set. It also provides a Copy method that will make a deep copy of all the DataTables in the set. 
Tip: If you call Copy and the Clear the original, your copied data will still exist unchanged.
	public ActionResult Index()
	{
            // Önce DataSet oluşturuldu
            // Sonra DataTable oluşturuldu (tablo)
            // Sonra oluşturulan tabloya kolonlar eklendi
            // Sonra bu kolonlara örnek veriler eklendi (datarow)
            // Sonra ilk başta oluşturduğumuz Dataset'in içine, DataTable'ımızı yerleştirdik ve View'a yolladık.
 
            DataSet ds = new DataSet();
            DataTable dt = new DataTable("YeniTablo");
 
            dt.Clear();
 
            dt.Columns.Add("Isim");
            dt.Columns.Add("SoyIsim");
 
            DataRow dr = dt.NewRow();
 
            // Row'lar farklı şekilde de eklenebilir. 2. örneğe bakılabilir.
            dr["Isim"] = "Eren";
            dr["SoyIsim"] = "OZTEN";
            dt.Rows.Add(dr);
 
            ds.Tables.Add(dt);
 
            return View(ds);

View:

 
@model System.Data.DataSet
 
@using System.Data
 
@foreach (DataRow row in Model.Tables["YeniTablo"].Rows)
{
    @(row["Isim"] + " " + row["SoyIsim"])
}
 
@{
    ViewBag.Title = "Home Page";
}

Bir örnek daha:
// GET: DataSet2
        public ActionResult Index()
        {
            // Create two DataTable instances.
            DataTable dataTable1 = new DataTable("Books");

            dataTable1.Rows.Add("Monte Cristo", 1);
            dataTable1.Rows.Add("Jane Eyre", 2);
 
            DataTable dataTable2 = new DataTable("Medications");
            dataTable2.Columns.Add("Id");
            dataTable2.Columns.Add("Medication");
            dataTable2.Rows.Add(1, "Atenolol");
            dataTable2.Rows.Add(2, "Amoxicillin");
 
            // Oluşturduğumuz dataTable'ları dataSet içine koyalım.
 
            DataSet dataSet = new DataSet("dataSetNam");
            dataSet.Tables.Add(dataTable1);
            dataSet.Tables.Add(dataTable2);
 
            // Visualize DataSet.
            return View(dataSet);

metadata
metadata nedir
Metadata is simply data about data. It means it is a description and context of the data. It helps to organize, find and understand data. Here are a few real world examples of metadata:
Those are some typical metadata elements:
1.	Title and description,
2.	Tags and categories,
3.	Who created and when,
4.	Who last modified and when,
5.	Who can access or update.
Every time you take a photo with today's cameras a bunch of metadata is gathered and saved with it:
•	date and time,
•	filename,
•	camera settings,
•	geolocation.

HTTPGet vs HTTPPost
Httpget nedir httppost nedir
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Un2JTC7tFPI
Videoyu izle…
Get yapınca veriler url ye yazılır. Post ta ise form yollanır… Url ile yollanmaz veri. Message body içinde yollanır.
Get metotlara url'ye yazıp enter yaparak ulaşılır. O yüzden tehlikeli olabilir…
DB'deki değerleri hem Get hem Post ile değiştirebiliriz tabi ki. Ama dediğimiz gibi get ile bunu yapmak tehlikelidir.
-
The GET Method
GET is used to request data from a specified resource. 
GET is one of the most common HTTP methods. 
Note that the query string (name/value pairs) is sent in the URL of a GET request: 
/test/demo_form.php?name1=value1&name2=value2
Some other notes on GET requests: 
GET requests can be cached
GET requests remain in the browser history
GET requests can be bookmarked
GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data
GET requests have length restrictions
GET requests are only used to request data (not modify)
The POST Method
POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource. 
The data sent to the server with POST is stored in the request body of the HTTP request: 
POST /test/demo_form.php HTTP/1.1
Host: w3schools.com
name1=value1&name2=value2
(yukarıda request body'nin neye benzediğini görmüş olduk. Get request'lerde request body yoktur. Veri url'den gönderilir)
Some other notes on POST requests:
POST requests are never cached
POST requests do not remain in the browser history
POST requests cannot be bookmarked
POST requests have no restrictions on data length
-
GET methodu HTTP istekleri arasındaki varsayılan yöntemdir.  GET metodu ile yapılan istekler tarayıcının adres satırında görünür. Sadece belirli boyutta veri gönderileceği zaman kullanılır.
POST metodu ise URL’ de görünmesini istemediğimiz veriler olduğunda kullanılabilir. POST yönteminde gönderebileceğimiz verinin boyutu ile ilgili bir sınır yoktur. Ayrıca gönderdiğimiz parametrelerin adres satırında görünmemesi dolayısıyla GET yöntemine göre daha güvenlidir. HTML form gönderileceği zaman neredeyse her zaman POST yöntemi tercih edilir.
Örnek vermek gerekirse Kisilers tablomuzun olduğu bir proje üzerinde kişi bilgilerini düzenlemek isteyebiliriz. Bunun için genellikle iki Action oluştururuz. Bunlardan biri kişinin ID sini parametre olarak alan gelen ID ye göre kişinin bilgilerini Edit formunda açan Action iken diğeri POST olduğunda yani Kaydet butonuna tıklandığında kullanılacak Actiondur.
 
public ActionResult Edit(int? id)
{
if (id == null)
 
{  return new HttpStatusCodeResult(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest);  }
 
Kisiler kisiler = db.Kisilers.Find(id);
 
if (kisiler == null) 
{
return HttpNotFound();
}
 
return View(kisiler);
}
 
Yukarıda ki Action’ da querystring’imiz kisa iken aşağıdakinde Kisilers tablosundaki kolon sayısına göre uzunluğu değişecek bir querystring söz konusu. Ayrıca buradan dönen bilgilerinde adres çubuğunda görünmesini istemediğimiz için POST methodunu kullanırız.
Önemli:
Browsers can cache GET requests, generally on static data, like images or scripts. But you can also allow browsers to cache GET requests to controller actions as well, using [OutputCache] or other similar ways, so if caching is turned on for a GET controller action, it's possible that clicking on a link leading to /Home/Index doesn't actually run the Index method on the server, but rather allows the browser to serve up the page from its own cache.
With this line of thinking, you can safely turn on caching on GET actions in which the data you're serving up doesn't change (or doesn't change often), with the knowledge that your server action won't fire every time.
POSTs won't be cached by the browser, so any POST is guaranteed to make it to the server.
-
Güzel bir açıklama:
Ignore caching for a moment. Another way of thinking about this is that search engines will store HTTP GET links during their indexing/crawling process, therefore they will show up in search results.
Suppose if your /Home/Index is implemented as GET but it lets say deletes a row in your Database, every time this link shows up on a search engine and somebody clicks it, you will have a delete row, and soon you have a lot deleted rows.

Bundling in MVC / Bundle in MVC 
Bundling  nedir, bundle nedir
Detaylı bilgil için link kesinlikle incelenmeli: https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/mvc/bundling-and-minification-in-asp.net-mvc
Bundle ingilizcede "demet" demektir... Bundling request'lerin daha hızlı gerçekleşmesi için yapılır. (Request load time'ı azaltmak için yapılır). İstenen statik dosyaları farklı farklı http request'lerle yollamaktansa hepsini bir bundle içinde (demette) toplayıp tek bir http request'iyle yollayabiliriz. Dolayısıyla bundling zaman yönünden verimlilik sağlayan bir tekniktir. Aklımıza şunu getirebiliriz: Çiçekleri tek tek vermektense bir demet halinde tek bir hamleyle veriyoruz. Bundling'in faydası sadece bununla sınırlı değildir.
Bundling, script/style dosyalarımızın gereksiz kısımlarını (gereksiz boşluklar vb) siler. Böylelikle dosyayı minimize etmiş olur (yani boyutunu düşürmüş olur). Bu da sunucu üzerine bindirilen yükü azaltır. Örneğin aşağıdaki kod parçacığını;
sayHello = function(name){
    //this is comment
    var msg = "Hello" + name;
    alert(msg);
}

Şu hale getirir:
sayHello=function(n){var t="Hello"+n;alert(t)}

Görüldüğü gibi comment satırını bile silmiş..
Not: Bahsedilen statik dosyalar hem script dosyaları, hem de style dosyaları olabilir. Script dosyalarımızı ScriptBundle kullanarak, style dosyalarımızı da StyleBundle kullanılarak gönderiyoruz.
Bundle'ları nasıl oluşturduğumuz ve View'da nasıl render ettiğimiz yukarıdaki linkte anlatılıyor. 

Script bundle:
https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/mvc/scriptbundle-mvc
bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle("~/bundles/myScriptsBundle").Include(
                "~/Scripts/myScript.js"));
buradaki  ScriptBundle'yi unutma. Bundle ye script koyacaksak; bunun adı ScriptBundle olmalı, yok eğer style dosyaları koyacaksak (CSS) o zaman adı StyleBundle olur.
~/bundles
bu kısmı yazmazsak çalışmıyor.
myScriptsBundle
bizim vereceğimiz özel isim, kafaya göre.
Scripts
bu ise script'in hangi file içinde olduğunu gösteriyor
myScript.js
çalıştırmak istediğimiz script dosyası..
sonra bu bundle'ı RENDER etmemiz gerekiyor. Yoksa çalışmaz. 
Scriptleri layoutta render edelim ki her sayfada geçerli olsun:
    @Scripts.Render("~/bundles/myScriptsBundle")

Not: render ederken diğer jquery vb dosyalarından sonra render et çünkü script'inde kesin jquery falan kullanmışsındır. o yüzden önce JQuery bundle render edilsin, sonra senin scriptin.

Style bundle:
STYLE'LAR BÖYLE YAPILMALI:
     bundles.Add(new StyleBundle("~/bundles/VereceginİsimKafayaGöre").Include(
                "~/Content/site2.css"));
    @Styles.Render("~/bundles/ VereceginİsimKafayaGöre")

Library		(GITHUB)
Library nedir
Yazılım kütüphanesi (Software Library), yazılım geliştiricilerinin program geliştirirken kullandıkları bir tür program kodları ve veriler takımıdır. Yazılım kütüphaneleri, yazılımcılar ve programlama dilinin derleyicilerine çalıştırılabilir programlar geliştirme konusunda yardımcı olurlar. Yazılım kütüphaneleri içinde genellikle önceden hazırlanmış kodlar, sınıflar, prosedürler, betikler, konfigürasyon verilerini içerir.
Bir geliştirici yazılım geliştirirken yazılımını daha işlevsel hale getirmek veya çeşitli fonksiyonlar kazandırmak için yazılım kütüphanelerinden faydalanır. Yazılım kütüphaneleri yazılımcıların iş yükünü hafifletir ve aynı kodu tekrar yazmalarına gerek kalmadan onlara hazır bir kalıp sunar. Basit bir örnekle açıklamamız gerekirse; bir geliştirici matematikle ilgili bir yazılım geliştirdiğinde bu yazılıma karmaşık matematik işlemlerini yaptırması için ayrı ayrı modüller yazmak zorunda kalacaktır. Bu kodları yazmaya uğraşmak yerine yazılım kütüphanesindeki bir matematik modülünü alıp bu modülü doğrudan kendi yazılımına ilave edebilir.

In computer science, a library is a collection of non-volatile resources used by computer programs, often for software development. These may include configuration data, documentation, help data, message templates, pre-written code and subroutines, classes, values or type specifications. In IBM's OS/360 and its successors they are referred to as partitioned data sets.

A library is also a collection of implementations of behavior, written in terms of a language, that has a well-defined interface by which the behavior is invoked. For instance, people who want to write a higher level program can use a library to make system calls instead of implementing those system calls over and over again. In addition, the behavior is provided for reuse by multiple independent programs. A program invokes the library-provided behavior via a mechanism of the language. For example, in a simple imperative language such as C, the behavior in a library is invoked by using C's normal function-call. What distinguishes the call as being to a library function, versus being to another function in the same program, is the way that the code is organized in the system.
Library code is organized in such a way that it can be used by multiple programs that have no connection to each other, while code that is part of a program is organized to be used only within that one program. 
The value of a library lies in the reuse of the behavior. When a program invokes a library, it gains the behavior implemented inside that library without having to implement that behavior itself. Libraries encourage the sharing of code in a modular fashion, and ease the distribution of the code.
The behavior implemented by a library can be connected to the invoking program at different program lifecycle phases. If the code of the library is accessed during the build of the invoking program, then the library is called a static library.[1] An alternative is to build the executable of the invoking program and distribute that, independently of the library implementation. The library behavior is connected after the executable has been invoked to be executed, either as part of the process of starting the execution, or in the middle of execution. In this case the library is called a dynamic library (loaded at runtime). A dynamic library can be loaded and linked when preparing a program for execution, by the linker. Alternatively, in the middle of execution, an application may explicitly request that a module be loaded.
Most compiled languages have a standard library although programmers can also create their own custom libraries. Most modern software systems provide libraries that implement the majority of the system services. Such libraries have commoditized the services which a modern application requires. As such, most code used by modern applications is provided in these system libraries.

Framework	   (GITHUB)
framework nedir
Önceden hazırlanmış belirli standartlar halinde kütüphanelerin bulunduğu bir iskelettir. İhtiyaca göre projemizi o iskelete dahil edip inşa ederiz.
Framework, yazılım geliştiricilerin kullandığı önceden hazırlanmış kütüphanelerin bunluduğu ve bunlara yenilerini ekleyebileceği yapıların adıdır. Gelişmiş frameworklerde form kontrolü, veri tabanı bağlantısı, kullanıcı giriş çıkış, mail atma, tema motoru gibi kütüphaneler mevcuttur.
Frameworkler ayrıca MVC (Model, View, Controller) gibi bölümlerden oluşarak projenizin daha okunabilir düzenlenebilir olmasını sağlamaktadır.
Yapılan projelerin çoğunda aradan belirli bir zaman geçtikten sonra düzenlemek zorlaşır. Hem kodların artması hem de yazılan kodun unutulması revize sürecini uzatmakta. Bu yapılar Modelde veritabanı işlemlerini, Controllerda genel mekaniği, Viewda ise görünüm kodu içerdiği için müdahale edilmesi gereken yer tam olarak bulanabilmektedir. 

A framework, or software framework, is a platform for developing software applications. It provides a foundation on which software developers can build programs for a specific platform. For example, a framework may include predefined classes and functions that can be used to process input, manage hardware devices, and interact with system software. This streamlines the development process since programmers don't need to reinvent the wheel each time they develop a new application.
A framework is similar to an application programming interface (API), though technically a framework includes an API. As the name suggests, a framework serves as a foundation for programming, while an API provides access to the elements supported by the framework. A framework may also include code libraries, a compiler, and other programs used in the software development process.
Several different types of software frameworks exist. Popular examples include ActiveX and .NET for Windows development, Cocoa for Mac OS X, Cocoa Touch for iOS, and the Android Application Framework for Android. Software development kits (SDKs) are available for each of these frameworks and include programming tools designed specifically for the corresponding framework. For example, Apple's Xcode development software includes a Mac OS X SDK designed for writing and compiling applications for the Cocoa framework.

Ad Hoc Query
Ad hoc nedir, ad hoc query nedir, ad-hoc query nedir
Definition - What does Ad Hoc Query mean?
In SQL, an ad hoc query is a loosely typed command/query whose value depends upon some variable. Each time the command is executed, the result is different, depending on the value of the variable. It cannot be predetermined and usually comes under dynamic programming SQL query. An ad hoc query is short lived and is created at runtime.
Techopedia explains Ad Hoc Query
As the word "ad hoc" suggests, this type of query is designed for a "particular purpose,"which is in contrast to a predefined query, which has the same output value on every execution. An ad hoc query does not reside in the system for a long time and is created dynamically on demand by the user. It is more efficient to use an ad hoc query in programming as it saves system resources, but, at the same time complex, ad hoc queries (have multiple variables) also challenge the processing speed and runtime memory of the system.

ORM   (Object Relational Mapping) / (Object-relational Mapper)
(GITHUB)
Orm nedir?
 Sql sorgularını yazmıyoruz da csharp tarafında metotlar kullanıyoruz, örneğin: Id si 12 olan datayı çekmek için entity framework'de Find metodunu kullanıyoruz değil mi, ama bu veriyi çekerken hiç sql sorgusu yazmadık. İşte bunu yapmamızı sağlayan şeyler ORM'dir. Bizim örneğimizde ise ORM miz Entity Framework'tür. 
Entity Framework'ün tanımı şudur: Entity Framework is an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) which is a type of tool that simplifies mapping between objects in your software to the tables and columns of a relational database. Entity Framework (EF) is an open source ORM framework for ADO.NET which is a part of .NET Framework.
ORM, veritabanında oluşturulan her bir nesneye (tabloya) karşılık uygulama tarafında bir nesne oluşturma işidir. Bu işlem bazı Frameworklerde ara yazılımlar sayesinde (ORM Tools), bazı frameworklerde ise elle gerçekleştirilmektedir.

.NET Framework    (GITHUB)
.NET nedir?
.NET Framework (pronounced as "dot net") is a software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows. It includes a large class library named as Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language interoperability (each language can use code written in other languages) across several programming languages. Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment (in contrast to a hardware environment) named the Common Language Runtime (CLR). The CLR is an application virtual machine that provides services such as security, memory management, and exception handling. As such, computer code written using .NET Framework is called "managed code". FCL and CLR together constitute the .NET Framework.

The .NET platform
.NET is a developer platform made up of tools, programming languages, and libraries for building many different types of applications.
The base platform provides components that apply to all different types of apps. Additional frameworks, such as ASP.NET, extend .NET with components for building specific types of apps.
Here are some things included in the .NET platform:
•	The C# programming language and its compilers
•	Base libraries for working with strings, dates, files/IO, and more
•	Editors and tools for Windows, Linux, macOS, and Docker

UI (User Interface)   (GITHUB)
The user interface (UI) is the point of human-computer interaction and communication in a device. This can include display screens, keyboards, a mouse and the appearance of a desktop. It is also the way through which a user interacts with an application or a website. The growing dependence of many businesses on web applications and mobile applications has led many companies to place increased priority on UI in an effort to improve the user's overall experience.
Types of user interfaces
The various types of user interfaces include:
•	graphical user interface (GUI)
•	command line interface (CLI)
•	menu-driven user interface
•	touch user interface
•	voice user interface (VUI)
•	form-based user interface
•	natural language user interface
Examples of user interfaces
Some examples of user interfaces include:
•	computer mouse
•	remote control
•	virtual reality
•	ATMs
•	speedometer
•	the old iPod click wheel
Websites such as Airbnb, Dropbox and Virgin America display strong user interface design. Sites like these have created pleasant, easily operable, user-centered designs (UCD) that focus on the user and their needs.

In early computers, there was very little user interface except for a few buttons at an operator's console. Many of these early computers used punched cards, prepared using keypunch machines, as the primary method of input for computer programs and data. While punched cards have been essentially obsolete in computing since 2012, some voting machines still use a punched card system.
The user interface evolved with the introduction of the command line interface, which first appeared as a nearly blank display screen with a line for user input. Users relied on a keyboard and a set of commands to navigate exchanges of information with the computer. This command line interface led to one in which menus (lists of choices written in text) predominated.
Finally, the GUI arrived, originating mainly in Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), adopted and enhanced by Apple and effectively standardized by Microsoft in its Windows operating systems. Elements of a GUI include such things as windows, pull-down menus, buttons, scroll bars and icons. With the increasing use of multimedia as part of the GUI, sound, voice, motion video and virtual reality are increasingly becoming the GUI for many applications.

UI ve UX çoğu kez beraber kullanılmalarına rağmen aslında çok farklı iki alandır. UI konusunda olmasa bile UX konusunda çok geride olan ülkemizde, maalesef bu işi profesyonel olarak yapan insanlar bile aralarındaki farkı çok bilmiyorlar. Ülkemizde bir UXD (User Interface Designer) ile tanışmanız çok zor. Türkiye’de bu işle ilgili çoğu insanın özgeçmişinde “UI/UX” yazar. Bunun bir sebebi aralarındaki farkın bilinmemesi, diğer sebebi ise internet sektörünü geriden takip etmemizden dolayı bu işi iki parçaya bölmenin bir lüks olarak görünmesidir.

Kısaca bahsetmek gerekirse; UI, aslında arayüz tasarımıdır. Televizyon kumandasının üstündeki tuşlar, bir arayüz tasarımı örneğidir. Tuşların yerleri, büyüklüğü, renkleri tasarımcının verdiği kararlar sonucu uygulanır. Arayüz tasarımının internet sitelerindeki karşılığı ise butonlar, grid yapısı, mizanpaj, renkler, boşluklar gibi tüm grafik elemanlardan oluşan görsel tasarımdır. Zamanla internet sitelerindeki interaksiyon arttıkça, önceleri çok da önemsenmeyen arayüz tasarımı da gittikçe önemli bir hal aldı. Kullanıcıların sitede rahatça dolaşmaları ve hatta kalmalarını sağlamak için basit ve kullanılabilir bir arayüz artık şart. Kullanıcılar bir sitede dolaşmaya veya terk etmeye saniyeler içerisinde karar veriyorlar. Yoğun uğraşlarla sitenize yönlendirdiğiniz kullanıcıları sitenizde tutamadığınız zaman da maalesef tüm uğraşlarınız boşa gidiyor.
The emerging popularity of mobile applications has also affected UI, leading to something called mobile UI. Mobile UI is specifically concerned with creating usable, interactive interfaces on the smaller screens of smartphones and tablets and improving special features, like touch controls.

Declaration	(GITHUB) 

Declaration nedir
This is when you state to the program that there will be an object of a certain type existing and what the name of that object will be.

Instantiation	 	(GITHUB)
Instantiation nedir, instantiation nedir
This is when memory is allocated for an object. This is what the new keyword is doing. A reference to the object that was created is returned from the new keyword.

Initialization	 	(GITHUB)

This is when values are put into the memory that was allocated. This is what the Constructor of a class does when using the new keyword.

A variable must also be initialized by having the reference to some object in memory passed to it.

Aşağıda örnekli olarak bu üçlünün tanımı yapılmış

Declaration - Declaring a variable means to introduce a new variable to the program. You define its type and its name.

int a; //a is declared
Instantiate - Instantiating a class means to create a new instance of the class.
MyObject x = new MyObject(); //we are making a new instance of the class MyObject
Açıklama 2:
Instantiate literally means "to create an instance of". In programming, this generally means to create an instance of an object (generally on "the heap"). This is done via the new keyword in most languages. ie: new object();. Most of the time you will also save a reference to the object. ie: object myObject = new object();.


Initialize - To initialize a variable means to assign it an initial value.
Açıklama 2: 
Initialize means to give an initial value to. In some languages, if you don't initialize a variable it will have arbitrary (dirty/garbage) data in it. In C# it is actually a compile-time error to read from an uninitialized variable.

int a; //a is declared
int a = 0; //a is declared AND initialized to 0
MyObject x = new MyObject(); //x is declared and initialized with an instance of MyObject
Assigning - Assigning to a variable means to provide the variable with a value.

int a = 0; //we are assigning to a; yes, initializing a variable means you assign it a value, so they do overlap!
a = 1; //we are assigning to a

Assigning:
Assigning is simply the storing of one value to a variable. x = 5 assigns the value 5 to the variable  x. In some languages, assignment cannot be combined with declaration, but in C# it can be: int x = 5;.

Note that the statement object myObject = new object(); combines all four of these.

new object() instantiates a new object object, returning a reference to it.
object myObject declares a new object reference.
= initializes the reference variable by assigning the value of the reference to it.

Int vs int32		(GITHUB)

It means that whether you define a variable of int or Int32, both are same.
int i = 345;
Int32 i = 345;// same as above
