Access Modifier = Access Specifier = Erişim Modifiyeri)                               	 (GITHUB)  (read -ama tekrar)
Access modifier nedir, public nedir, private nedir, protected nedir, internal nedir, access specifier nedir, access modifier nedir
Access specifier de denir, access modifier de denir. Kaynaklar incelendi: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/What-are-the-different-access-specifiers-in-Chash-NET
All types and type members have an accessibility level, which controls whether they can be used from other code in your assembly or other assemblies. You can use the following access modifiers to specify the accessibility of a type or member when you declare it
public

The type or member can be accessed by any other code in the same assembly or another assembly that references it.
private

The type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class or struct.
protected

The type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class, or in a class that is derived from that class. (class dışından erişemezsin)

internal

The type or member can be accessed by any code in the same assembly, but not from another assembly.
protected internal 

The type or member can be accessed by any code in the assembly in which it is declared, or from within a derived class in another assembly.
private protected 

The type or member can be accessed only within its declaring assembly, by code in the same class or in a type that is derived from that class.
The following examples demonstrate how to specify access modifiers on a type and member:
public class Bicycle
{
    public void Pedal() { }
}
Not all access modifiers can be used by all types or members in all contexts, and in some cases the accessibility of a type member is constrained by the accessibility of its containing type. The following sections provide more details about accessibility.
Class and Struct Accessibility
Classes and structs that are declared directly within a namespace (in other words, that are not nested within other classes or structs) can be either public or internal. Internal is the default if no access modifier is specified.
Struct members, including nested classes and structs, can be declared as public, internal, or private. Class members, including nested classes and structs, can be public, protected internal, protected, internal, private protected or private. The access level for class members and struct members, including nested classes and structs, is private by default. Private nested types are not accessible from outside the containing type.
Derived classes cannot have greater accessibility than their base types. In other words, you cannot have a public class B that derives from an internal class A. If this were allowed, it would have the effect of making A public, because all protected or internal members of A are accessible from the derived class.
You can enable specific other assemblies to access your internal types by using the InternalsVisibleToAttribute. For more information, see Friend Assemblies.

MySQL, MsSQL, T-SQL, Oracle, PL-SQL 	(GITHUB) (read -ama tekrar)
MySQL nedir, MsSQL nedir, T-SQL nedir, t sql nedir, tsql nedir, oracle nedir, plsql nedir, pl-sql nedir, pl/sql nedir
SQL is a database language used with Oracle Database.
MySQL is a database itself that uses SQL language.
Biz T-SQL üzerinden çalışıyoruz (MSSQL'de), peki MySQL nedir?
MySQL is an open source SQL database, which is developed by a Swedish company – MySQL AB. MySQL is pronounced as "my ess-que-ell," in contrast with SQL, pronounced "sequel."
MySQL is supporting many different platforms including Microsoft Windows, the major Linux distributions, UNIX, and Mac OS X.
MySQL has free and paid versions, depending on its usage (non-commercial/commercial) and features. MySQL comes with a very fast, multi-threaded, multi-user and robust SQL database server.
MS SQL 
MsSQL Server is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft Inc. Its primary query languages are − T-SQL, ANSI SQL

Oracle
It is a very large multi-user based database management system. Oracle is a relational database management system developed by 'Oracle Corporation'.

Oracle works to efficiently manage its resources, a database of information among the multiple clients requesting and sending data in the network.
It is an excellent database server choice for client/server computing. Oracle supports all major operating systems for both clients and servers, including MSDOS, NetWare, UnixWare, OS/2 and most UNIX flavors.

Oracle ile MYSQL arasındaki farklar üzerine:
SQL is a database language used with Oracle Database.
MySQL is a database itself that uses SQL language.
The difference is that MySQL is free, and the world's most popular database, and Oracle isn't free (except with trials and certain products) and makes billions from selling premium database software to large enterprises and SME.

There are many more differences between Oracle and MySQL.We can summarise them as follows-
1.Oracle is way more powerful than MySQL
2.Oracle supports distributed databases while MySQL doesn’t
3.Oracle supports save points while MySQL doesn’t
4.Oracle allows programs within the database while MySQL doesn’t
5.Oracle is suited for enterprise deployments while MySQL is suited for small to medium scale
6.Oracle requires that you pay a licensing fee while MySQL doesn’t
-- Daha anlamlı bir açıklama:
This might be a slightly controversial view ( and this is all in my opinion).
   
I have been a Developer for most of my career and I have used an old hierarchical DB, called HP Image 3000, Oracle, MS SQL and MySQL.
IMO, there is a lot of snobbery around Oracle. Its very good, but very expensive and in my opinion largely unnecessary and over used.
When you consider how many large companies and applications use MySQL without any issue, it will cope with 90% of demand. Hardware is so powerful now and the original concerns about performance are largely negated by the raw power of the hardware. Oracle should be a niche market and not a large player, as it really isn’t needed.
I worked for a large American company who used Oracle, I asked why, they said because its the best, I persisted and said what do you mean, they had no answer.
MySQL will be fine for most things and as its free, why not use that. The advent of cloud computing and the pricing model of many data centers, makes licencing very expensive (virtual CPU’s cores) for both Oracle and MS SQL.
Facebook, Uber and Google, used/use MySQL, so the idea its not scalable, is a bit ridiculous.
What is sad and I really mean it, is that the traditional IT Operations and the DBA role in IT, will slowly disappear, as its not really needed unless in some extreme situations.
-- Diğer açıklama:

Oracle is a Database tool that uses PL/SQL language.
MySQL is a also a Database tool itself that uses SQL language.
What is PL/SQL?
Pl-sql nedir plsql nedir pl/sql nedir
PL/SQL is an extension of Structured Query Language (SQL) that is used in Oracle. Unlike SQL, PL/SQL allows the programmer to write code in a procedural format. Full form of PL/SQL is "Procedural Language extensions to SQL".
It combines the data manipulation power of SQL with the processing power of procedural language to create super powerful SQL queries.
PL/SQL means instructing the compiler 'what to do' through SQL and 'how to do' through its procedural way.
Similar to other database languages, it gives more control to the programmers by the use of loops, conditions and object-oriented concepts.

SQL 	 (GITHUB) (read -ama tekrar)
SQL nedir
In 1970's the product called 'SEQUEL', structured English query language, developed by IBM and later SEQUEL was renamed to 'SQL' which stands for Structured Query Language.
In 1986, SQL was approved by ANSI (American national Standards Institute) and in 1987, it was approved by ISO (International Standards Organization).
SQL is a structure query language which is a common database language for all RDBMS products. Different RDBMS product vendors have developed their own database language by extending SQL for their own RDBMS products.
T-SQL stands for Transact Structure Query Language which is a Microsoft product and is an extension of SQL Language. Example:
MS SQL Server --> SQL\T-SQL
ORACLE        --> SQL\PL-SQL

Dataset 	(GITHUB)   (read -ama tekrar)
DataSet: This is a collection of DataTables. We use the DataSet type to store many DataTables in a single collection. Conceptually, the DataSet acts as a set of DataTable instances. 
Usage: DataSet simplifies programs that use many DataTables. To effectively use the DataSet, you will need to have some DataTables handy. We begin by creating some. 
Create: In this program, we create two DataTables. One stores two rows of patient information. And the second stores two rows of medication information. 
Next: We create a DataSet with the DataSet constructor. Then we add the two DataTables to the DataSet instance. Finally we print the XML. 
DataSetName: Every DataSet can have a name specified. Usually, it is easiest to specify this inside the DataSet constructor. But you don't always know the name at this time. 
However: You can also change the name by assigning to the DataSetName property. You can also read the DataSetName property. 
Copy, Clear: DataSet has a Clear method that clears all the DataTables in the set. It also provides a Copy method that will make a deep copy of all the DataTables in the set. 
Tip: If you call Copy and the Clear the original, your copied data will still exist unchanged.
public ActionResult Index()
	{
            // Önce DataSet oluşturuldu
            // Sonra DataTable oluşturuldu (tablo)
            // Sonra oluşturulan tabloya kolonlar eklendi
            // Sonra bu kolonlara örnek veriler eklendi (datarow)
            // Sonra ilk başta oluşturduğumuz Dataset'in içine, DataTable'ımızı yerleştirdik ve View'a yolladık.
 
            DataSet ds = new DataSet();
            DataTable dt = new DataTable("YeniTablo");
 
            dt.Clear();
 
            dt.Columns.Add("Isim");
            dt.Columns.Add("SoyIsim");
 
            DataRow dr = dt.NewRow();

metadata 	(GITHUB)  (read -ama tekrar)
metadata nedir
Metadata is simply data about data. It means it is a description and context of the data. It helps to organize, find and understand data. Here are a few real world examples of metadata:
Those are some typical metadata elements:
1.	Title and description,
2.	Tags and categories,
3.	Who created and when,
4.	Who last modified and when,
5.	Who can access or update.
Every time you take a photo with today's cameras a bunch of metadata is gathered and saved with it:
•	date and time,
•	filename,
•	camera settings,
•	geolocation.

Encapsulation   	(GITHUB) 	(read -ama tekrar)
encapsulation nedir
Encapsulation is implemented by using access specifiers. An access specifier defines the scope and visibility of a class member. C# supports the following access specifiers −
•	Public
•	Private
•	Protected
•	Internal
•	Protected internal

Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. In a different way, encapsulation is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.
•	Technically in encapsulation, the variables or data of a class are hidden from any other class and can be accessed only through any member function of own class in which they are declared.
•	As in encapsulation, the data in a class is hidden from other classes, so it is also known as data-hiding.
•	Encapsulation can be achieved by: Declaring all the variables in the class as private and using C# Properties in the class to set and get the values of variables.

 

using System;
  
public class DemoEncap
{
    // private variables declared 
    // these can only be accessed by public methods of class 
    private String studentName;
    private int studentAge;
 
    // using accessors to get and set the value of studentName 
    public String Name
    {
        get
        {
            return studentName;
        }
 
        set
        {
            studentName = value;
        }
    }
 
    // using accessors to get and set the value of studentAge 
    public int Age
    {
        get
        {
            return studentAge;
        }
 
        set
        {
            studentAge = value;
        }
    }
}
 
// Driver Class 
class GFG
{
 
    // Main Method 
    static public void Main()
    {
 
        // creating object 
        DemoEncap obj = new DemoEncap();
 
        // calls set accessor of the property Name,  
        // and pass "Ankita" as value of the  
        // standard field 'value' 
        obj.Name = "Ankita";
 
        // calls set accessor of the property Age,  
        // and pass "21" as value of the  
        // standard field 'value' 
        obj.Age = 21;
 
        // Displaying values of the variables 
        Console.WriteLine("Name: " + obj.Name);
        Console.WriteLine("Age: " + obj.Age);
    }
}
Output:
Name: Ankita
Age: 21
Explanation: In the above program the class DemoEncap is encapsulated as the variables are declared as private. To access these private variables we are using the Name and Age accessors which contains the get and set method to retrieve and set the values of private fields. Accessors are defined as public so that they can access in other class.

Advantages of Encapsulation:
•	Data Hiding: The user will have no idea about the inner implementation of the class. It will not be visible to the user that how the class is stored values in the variables. He only knows that we are passing the values to accessors and variables are getting initialized to that value.
•	Increased Flexibility: We can make the variables of the class as read-only or write-only depending on our requirement. If we wish to make the variables as read-only then we have to only use Get Accessor in the code. If we wish to make the variables as write-only then we have to only use Set Accessor.
•	Reusability: Encapsulation also improves the re-usability and easy to change with new requirements.
•	Testing code is easy: Encapsulated code is easy to test for unit testing.

String  	(GITHUB)		(read -ama tekrar)
String nedir
Note that you do not use the new operator to create a string object except when initializing the string with an array of chars.
Msdn goes here:
A string is an object of type String whose value is text. Internally, the text is stored as a sequential read-only collection of Char objects. There is no null-terminating character at the end of a C# string; therefore a C# string can contain any number of embedded null characters ('\0'). The Length property of a string represents the number of Char objects it contains, not the number of Unicode characters. To access the individual Unicode code points in a string, use the StringInfo object.
string vs. System.String
In C#, the string keyword is an alias for String. Therefore, String and string are equivalent, and you can use whichever naming convention you prefer. 
Declaring and Initializing Strings
You can declare and initialize strings in various ways, as shown in the following example:
(declare nedir örnek, initialization nedir örnek)
// Declare without initializing.
string message1;

// Initialize to null.
string message2 = null;

// Initialize as an empty string.
// Use the Empty constant instead of the literal "".
string message3 = System.String.Empty;

// Initialize with a regular string literal.
string oldPath = "c:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio 8.0";

// Initialize with a verbatim string literal.
string newPath = @"c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0";

// Use System.String if you prefer.
System.String greeting = "Hello World!";

// In local variables (i.e. within a method body)
// you can use implicit typing.
var temp = "I'm still a strongly-typed System.String!";

// Use a const string to prevent 'message4' from
// being used to store another string value.
const string message4 = "You can't get rid of me!";

// Use the String constructor only when creating
// a string from a char*, char[], or sbyte*. See
// System.String documentation for details.
char[] letters = { 'A', 'B', 'C' };
string alphabet = new string(letters);
Note that you do not use the new operator to create a string object except when initializing the string with an array of chars.
Initialize a string with the Empty constant value to create a new String object whose string is of zero length. The string literal representation of a zero-length string is "". By initializing strings with the Empty value instead of null, you can reduce the chances of a NullReferenceException occurring. Use the static IsNullOrEmpty(String) method to verify the value of a string before you try to access it.

Framework	   (GITHUB)    	(read -ama tekrar)
framework nedir
Önceden hazırlanmış belirli standartlar halinde kütüphanelerin bulunduğu bir iskelettir. İhtiyaca göre projemizi o iskelete dahil edip inşa ederiz.
Framework, yazılım geliştiricilerin kullandığı önceden hazırlanmış kütüphanelerin bunluduğu ve bunlara yenilerini ekleyebileceği yapıların adıdır. Gelişmiş frameworklerde form kontrolü, veri tabanı bağlantısı, kullanıcı giriş çıkış, mail atma, tema motoru gibi kütüphaneler mevcuttur.
Frameworkler ayrıca MVC (Model, View, Controller) gibi bölümlerden oluşarak projenizin daha okunabilir düzenlenebilir olmasını sağlamaktadır.
Yapılan projelerin çoğunda aradan belirli bir zaman geçtikten sonra düzenlemek zorlaşır. Hem kodların artması hem de yazılan kodun unutulması revize sürecini uzatmakta. Bu yapılar Modelde veritabanı işlemlerini, Controllerda genel mekaniği, Viewda ise görünüm kodu içerdiği için müdahale edilmesi gereken yer tam olarak bulanabilmektedir. 

A framework, or software framework, is a platform for developing software applications. It provides a foundation on which software developers can build programs for a specific platform. For example, a framework may include predefined classes and functions that can be used to process input, manage hardware devices, and interact with system software. This streamlines the development process since programmers don't need to reinvent the wheel each time they develop a new application.
A framework is similar to an application programming interface (API), though technically a framework includes an API. As the name suggests, a framework serves as a foundation for programming, while an API provides access to the elements supported by the framework. A framework may also include code libraries, a compiler, and other programs used in the software development process.
Several different types of software frameworks exist. Popular examples include ActiveX and .NET for Windows development, Cocoa for Mac OS X, Cocoa Touch for iOS, and the Android Application Framework for Android. Software development kits (SDKs) are available for each of these frameworks and include programming tools designed specifically for the corresponding framework. For example, Apple's Xcode development software includes a Mac OS X SDK designed for writing and compiling applications for the Cocoa framework.

Library	   (GITHUB) 		(read -ama tekrar)
Library nedir
Yazılım kütüphanesi (Software Library), yazılım geliştiricilerinin program geliştirirken kullandıkları bir tür program kodları ve veriler takımıdır. Yazılım kütüphaneleri, yazılımcılar ve programlama dilinin derleyicilerine çalıştırılabilir programlar geliştirme konusunda yardımcı olurlar. Yazılım kütüphaneleri içinde genellikle önceden hazırlanmış kodlar, sınıflar, prosedürler, betikler, konfigürasyon verilerini içerir.
Bir geliştirici yazılım geliştirirken yazılımını daha işlevsel hale getirmek veya çeşitli fonksiyonlar kazandırmak için yazılım kütüphanelerinden faydalanır. Yazılım kütüphaneleri yazılımcıların iş yükünü hafifletir ve aynı kodu tekrar yazmalarına gerek kalmadan onlara hazır bir kalıp sunar. Basit bir örnekle açıklamamız gerekirse; bir geliştirici matematikle ilgili bir yazılım geliştirdiğinde bu yazılıma karmaşık matematik işlemlerini yaptırması için ayrı ayrı modüller yazmak zorunda kalacaktır. Bu kodları yazmaya uğraşmak yerine yazılım kütüphanesindeki bir matematik modülünü alıp bu modülü doğrudan kendi yazılımına ilave edebilir.
In computer science, a library is a collection of non-volatile resources used by computer programs, often for software development. These may include configuration data, documentation, help data, message templates, pre-written code and subroutines, classes, values or type specifications. In IBM's OS/360 and its successors they are referred to as partitioned data sets.
A library is also a collection of implementations of behavior, written in terms of a language, that has a well-defined interface by which the behavior is invoked. For instance, people who want to write a higher level program can use a library to make system calls instead of implementing those system calls over and over again. In addition, the behavior is provided for reuse by multiple independent programs. A program invokes the library-provided behavior via a mechanism of the language. For example, in a simple imperative language such as C, the behavior in a library is invoked by using C's normal function-call. What distinguishes the call as being to a library function, versus being to another function in the same program, is the way that the code is organized in the system.
Library code is organized in such a way that it can be used by multiple programs that have no connection to each other, while code that is part of a program is organized to be used only within that one program. 
The value of a library lies in the reuse of the behavior. When a program invokes a library, it gains the behavior implemented inside that library without having to implement that behavior itself. Libraries encourage the sharing of code in a modular fashion, and ease the distribution of the code.
The behavior implemented by a library can be connected to the invoking program at different program lifecycle phases. If the code of the library is accessed during the build of the invoking program, then the library is called a static library.[1] An alternative is to build the executable of the invoking program and distribute that, independently of the library implementation. The library behavior is connected after the executable has been invoked to be executed, either as part of the process of starting the execution, or in the middle of execution. In this case the library is called a dynamic library (loaded at runtime). A dynamic library can be loaded and linked when preparing a program for execution, by the linker. Alternatively, in the middle of execution, an application may explicitly request that a module be loaded.
Most compiled languages have a standard library although programmers can also create their own custom libraries. Most modern software systems provide libraries that implement the majority of the system services. Such libraries have commoditized the services which a modern application requires. As such, most code used by modern applications is provided in these system libraries.

Result set   (GITHUB) 	(read)
Result set nedir
An SQL result set is a set of rows from a database, as well as metadata about the query such as the column names, and the types and sizes of each column. Depending on the database system, the number of rows in the result set may or may not be known. Usually, this number is not known up front because the result set is built on-the-fly.
A result set is effectively a table. The ORDER BY clause can be used in a query to impose a certain sort condition on the rows. Without that clause, there is no guarantee whatsoever on the order in which the rows are returned.

Executable Code (GITHUB)	(read)
Executable Code nedir
Software in a form that can be run in the computer. Executable code generally refers to machine language, which is the set of native instructions the computer carries out in hardware. Executable files in the DOS/Windows world use .EXE and .COM file extensions, while executable files in Mac, Linux and Unix do not require specific extensions. They are identified by their file structure.

Executable code may also refer to programs written in interpreted languages that require additional software to actually execute. Some interpreted languages remain in their source code form, such as JavaScript and VBScript, while others are compiled into an intermediate language, such as Java and Visual Basic. Interpreted languages require software "runtime engines" to convert the program into executable instructions for a particular CPU family that the hardware executes. See machine language, runtime engine, linker, compiler, intermediate language, x86 and Java Virtual Machine.

Iteration (GITHUB)	(read)
iteration nedir iterate nedir

Iteration, in the context of computer programming, is a process wherein a set of instructions or structures are repeated in a sequence a specified number of times or until a condition is met. When the first set of instructions is executed again, it is called an iteration. When a sequence of instructions is executed in a repeated manner, it is called a loop.

Iteration is the repetition of a process in a computer program, usually done with the help of loops.
An example of an iteration programming language is as follows:

Consider a database table containing 1000 student records. Each record contains the following fields:
•	First name
•	Last name
•	Roll no
If one wants to copy all the student records from the database and print them, the best way to retrieve the record is to iterate or loop through each record. It can be executed using the for loop statement as shown below:

for (int i=0; i<1000; i++)
{
\\Print first name and last name from table
}

In the above example, i is an iterator starting from the first student record to the last student record.

ArrayList Class  (GITHUB)   (read)
arrayList nedir
Implements the IList interface using an array whose size is dynamically increased as required.
The following example shows how to create and initialize an ArrayList and how to display its values.
using System;
using System.Collections;
public class SamplesArrayList  {

   public static void Main()  {

      // Creates and initializes a new ArrayList.
      ArrayList myAL = new ArrayList();
      myAL.Add("Hello");
      myAL.Add("World");
      myAL.Add("!");

      // Displays the properties and values of the ArrayList.
      Console.WriteLine( "myAL" );
      Console.WriteLine( "    Count:    {0}", myAL.Count );
      Console.WriteLine( "    Capacity: {0}", myAL.Capacity );
      Console.Write( "    Values:" );
      PrintValues( myAL );
   }

   public static void PrintValues( IEnumerable myList )  {
      foreach ( Object obj in myList )
         Console.Write( "   {0}", obj );
      Console.WriteLine();
   }

}


/* 
This code produces output similar to the following:

myAL
    Count:    3
    Capacity: 4
    Values:   Hello   World   !

*/

 Important
We don't recommend that you use the ArrayList class for new development. Instead, we recommend that you use the generic List<T> class. The ArrayList class is designed to hold heterogeneous collections of objects. However, it does not always offer the best performance. Instead, we recommend the following:
•	For a heterogeneous collection of objects, use the List<Object> (in C#) or List(Of Object) (in Visual Basic) type.
•	For a homogeneous collection of objects, use the List<T> class.
See Performance Considerations in the List<T> reference topic for a discussion of the relative performance of these classes. See Non-generic collections shouldn't be used on GitHub for general information on the use of generic instead of non-generic collection types.
The ArrayList is not guaranteed to be sorted. You must sort the ArrayList by calling its Sort method prior to performing operations (such as BinarySearch) that require the ArrayList to be sorted. To maintain a collection that is automatically sorted as new elements are added, you can use the SortedSet<T> class.
The capacity of an ArrayList is the number of elements the ArrayList can hold. As elements are added to an ArrayList, the capacity is automatically increased as required through reallocation. The capacity can be decreased by calling TrimToSize or by setting the Capacity property explicitly.
.NET Framework only: For very large ArrayList objects, you can increase the maximum capacity to 2 billion elements on a 64-bit system by setting the enabled attribute of the <gcAllowVeryLargeObjects> configuration element to true in the run-time environment.
Elements in this collection can be accessed using an integer index. Indexes in this collection are zero-based.
The ArrayList collection accepts null as a valid value. It also allows duplicate elements.
Using multidimensional arrays as elements in an ArrayList collection is not supported.

SharePoint is a web-based collaborative platform that integrates with Microsoft Office. Launched in 2001, SharePoint is primarily sold as a document management and storage system, but the product is highly configurable and usage varies substantially among organizations.
Microsoft states that SharePoint has 190 million users across 200,000 customer organizations.
There are the Windows SharePoint Services (WSS), the Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) and Microsoft Search Server. Each bring their own functionalities to the table and build upon each other. 
When looking up what SharePoint is, you get a lot of different answers from the Internet:
•	Microsoft SharePoint is a browser-based collaboration and document management platform from Microsoft - Wikipedia
•	Microsoft's content management system. It allows groups to set up a centralized, password protected space for document sharing. Documents can be stored, downloaded and edited, then uploaded for continued sharing. - SAIT Polytechnic Teaching - Glossary
•	SharePoint is a web-based intranet that can help improve your organization's effectiveness by streamlining the management of and access to data. - Creative SharePoint
•	SharePoint is an enterprise information portal, from Microsoft, that can be configured to run Intranet, Extranet and Internet sites. - SharePoint HQ
•	{..} SharePoint is a sort of sharing/blogging/wiki-style server that mainly provides a back end to Microsoft Office - Jack Schofield, Technical Writer Guardian newspaper, UK.
So what is SharePoint? Let's first look at it from a technical perspective. There are the Windows SharePoint Services (WSS), the Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) and Microsoft Search Server. Each bring their own functionality to the table and build upon each other.
Windows SharePoint Services function the basic functionality that Gartner calls Basic Content Services. It offers the user access to Versioning and Check-in/Checkout functionality. WSS can then be extended through the use of the applets to add additional collaborative functions like email alerts, shared calendars, etc.
Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) sits on top of WSS and adds additional features, both to the underlying WSS layer as well as additional ways for the end-user to interact with the repository. The data resides in a SQL Database. Using Webparts it can then present this information to the user using a wide range of different modules and for interaction in different business scenarios. These include such diverse applications as Collaboration, Document management, Records Management (including DOD 5015.2 certified components), Workflow, Personalization, more complex metadata models as well as Blogs and Wikis from the Web 2.0 side.

Semantics 		(GITHUB)	  (read)
semantics nedir, semantic nedir, syntax nedir
In linguistics, semantics is the study of meanings. In computer science, the term is frequently used to differentiate the meaning of an instruction from its format. The format, which covers the spelling of language components and the rules controlling how components are combined, is called the language's syntax. For example, if you misspell a command, it is a syntax error. If, on the other hand, you enter a legal command that does not make any sense in the current context, it is a semantic error.

In programming language theory, semantics is the field concerned with the rigorous mathematical study of the meaning of programming languages. It does so by evaluating the meaning of syntactically valid strings defined by a specific programming language, showing the computation involved. In such a case that the evaluation would be of syntactically invalid strings, the result would be non-computation. Semantics describes the processes a computer follows when executing a program in that specific language. This can be shown by describing the relationship between the input and output of a program, or an explanation of how the program will be executed on a certain platform, hence creating a model of computation.
Formal semantics, for instance, helps to write compilers, better understand what a program is doing, and to prove, e.g., that the following if statement
if 1 == 1 then S1 else S2
has the same effect as S1 alone.

Type Safety / Type Safe		(GITHUB)	 (read-karışık olay)
Type safety nedir, type safe nedir type-safe neir
Type safety means preventing type errors. Type error occurs when data type of one type is assigned to other type UNKNOWINGLY and we get undesirable results.
Type-safety should not be confused with static / dynamic typing or strong / weak typing.
A type-safe language is one where the only operations that one can execute on data are the ones that are condoned by the data's type. That is, if your data is of type X and X doesn't support operation y, then the language will not allow you to to execute y(X).
This definition doesn't set rules on when this is checked. It can be at compile time (static typing) or at runtime (dynamic typing), typically through exceptions. It can be a bit of both: some statically typed languages allow you to cast data from one type to another, and the validity of casts must be checked at runtime (imagine that you're trying to cast an Object to a Consumer - the compiler has no way of knowing whether it's acceptable or not).
Type-safety does not necessarily mean strongly typed, either - some languages are notoriously weakly typed, but still arguably type safe. Take Javascript, for example: its type system is as weak as they come, but still strictly defined. It allows automatic casting of data (say, strings to ints), but within well defined rules. There is to my knowledge no case where a Javascript program will behave in an undefined fashion, and if you're clever enough (I'm not), you should be able to predict what will happen when reading Javascript code.
An example of a type-unsafe programming language is C: reading / writing an array value outside of the array's bounds has an undefined behaviour by specification. It's impossible to predict what will happen. C is a language that has a type system, but is not type safe.

In computer science, type safety is the extent to which a programming language discourages or prevents type errors. A type error is erroneous or undesirable program behaviour caused by a discrepancy between differing data types for the program's constants, variables, and methods (functions), e.g., treating an integer (int) as a floating-point number (float). Type safety is sometimes alternatively considered to be a property of a computer program rather than the language in which that program is written; that is, some languages have type-safe facilities that can be circumvented by programmers who adopt practices that exhibit poor type safety. The formal type-theoretic definition of type safety is considerably stronger than what is understood by most programmers.

F# / F Sharp 		(GITHUB)
Fsharp nedir f sharp nedir f# nedir
F# originates from Microsoft Research, Cambridge, UK. The language was originally designed and implemented by Don Syme,[6] according to whom in the fsharp team, they say the F is for "Fun".[24] Andrew Kennedy contributed to the design of units of measure.[6] The Visual F# Tools for Visual Studio are developed by Microsoft.[6] The F# Software Foundation developed the F# open-source compiler and tools, incorporating the open-source compiler implementation provided by the Microsoft Visual F# Tools team.[11]

F# (pronounced F sharp) is a general purpose, strongly typed, multi-paradigm programming language that encompasses functional, imperative, and object-oriented programming methods. F# is most often used as a cross-platform Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) language, but it can also generate JavaScript[9] and graphics processing unit (GPU) code.[10]

Syntax:
F# da göze çarpan ilk önemli komut "let" dir. Bu komut ile bir değişkene değeri kaydederiz. Örnek:

Statik Tipli Diller İle Dinamik Tipli Diller Arasındaki Farklar 	(GITHUB) (Read)

Programlama dillerinde tip sistemleri, değerleri belirli tiplerde gruplarlar. Aynı değerler,belirlenen tip adı altında gruplanarak yazılım geliştiricilerin veriyi çok daha etkili ve anlamlı kullanmasına olanak sağlar. Verinin işlenip çıktı olarak alınması noktasında verilerin etkili ve hataya yol açmadan işlenmesi çok önemlidir. Birbirinden alakasız veriler üzerinde işlem yapılması tip sistemlerinin getirdiği bu özellik sayesinde önlenir. 
Programlama dillerinde yapılan her işlem öncesi hataları önlemek için verilerin tip kontrolü yapılır. Bu tür kontrollere ”Checking”  adı verilir. Checking işlemleri compile-time (derleme esnasında) veya run-time (çalışma esnasında) olarak yapılır. İşte bu farklılık Statik Tipli ve Dinamik Tipli dillerin temel ayrım noktalarından biridir.
Statik Tipli dillerde her değişkenin değişmez bir tipi olmak zorundadır. Uygulama geliştire ya bu tipi bizzat belirler yada Derleyici tarafından belirlenir. Statik Tipli dillerde yapılan işlemlerden önce Tip Konrolü yapıldığı için, operandların tiplerinin belirlenmesi gerekir. Tip kontrolleri compile (derleme) esnasında yapılır. Bu tarz dillere örnek olarak Java, C, C++ ,C# ,F# ,Ada ,Fortran ,Haskell ,ML ,Objective-C ,Pascal dilleri verilebilir.
Dinamik Tipli dillerde değerler değişmez bir tipe sahiptir. Ancak değişkenler ve ifadelerin belirli bir tipe sahip olma zorunlulukları yoktur. Her bir işlem esnasında, operandlar değişik değerler üretebilir. Değişkenlerin ve ifadelerin tipleri run-time (çalışma) esnasında belirlenir. Bu tarz dillere örnek olarak Groovy, Javascript, Lisp, Lua, PHP, Prolog, Python, Ruby, Smalltalk dilleri verilebilir.
Statik Tipli Diller ile Dinamik Tipli dillerin birbirlerine üstünlükleri konusunda birçok fikir ortaya atılıyor. İkisinin de birbirlerine üstün oldukları noktalar var.
Statik Tipli dillerde derleme (compile-time) esnasında tip kontrolü yapıldığı için programın çalışması esnasında ekstra tip kontrolü yapılmaz, bu da uygulamanın çok daha verimli ve hızlı çalışması anlamına gelir. Dinamik Tipli dillerde ise çalışma (run-time) esnasında kontrol yapılması ufak da olsa bir yavaşlamaya sebep olmaktadır. Ayrıca yine bu özellikten dolayı her değişkenin tip bilgisi hafızada saklanmak zorundadır. Bu durum ekstra bir hafıza yükü anlamına gelir. Statik Tipli dillerde derleme (compile-time) esnasında tip kontrolü yapıldığı için ekstra bir hafızaya gerek duyulmaz.
Statik Tipli dillerde derleme (compile-time) esnasında herhangi bir hata yakalanmadı ise tip hatası oluşmamış demektir yani Dinamik Tipli dillere nazaran çok daha güvenlidir. Dinamik Tipli dillerde ise böyle bir kesinlik bulunmaz. Öte yandan Dinamik Tipli diller Developer’lara çok büyük esneklik sağlar. Gelen verinin türünün bilinmediği uygulamalarda çok kullanışlıdır. Ayrıca uygulama geliştirenler bir değişkene farklı noktalarda farklı değerler atayabilirler.

Extension Methods in C#  (GITHUB) (read)
Extension method nedir 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/extension-methods
Extension methods enable you to "add" methods to existing types without creating a new derived type, recompiling, or otherwise modifying the original type. Extension methods are static methods, but they're called as if they were instance methods on the extended type. For client code written in C#, F# and Visual Basic, there's no apparent difference between calling an extension method and the methods defined in a type.
The most common extension methods are the LINQ standard query operators that add query functionality to the existing System.Collections.IEnumerable and System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<T> types. To use the standard query operators, first bring them into scope with a using System.Linq directive. Then any type that implements IEnumerable<T> appears to have instance methods such as GroupBy, OrderBy, Average, and so on. You can see these additional methods in IntelliSense statement completion when you type "dot" after an instance of an IEnumerable<T> type such as List<T> or Array.
OrderBy Example
The following example shows how to call the standard query operator OrderBy method on an array of integers. The expression in parentheses is a lambda expression. Many standard query operators take lambda expressions as parameters, but this isn't a requirement for extension methods. For more information, see Lambda Expressions.
class ExtensionMethods2
{

    static void Main()
    {
        int[] ints = { 10, 45, 15, 39, 21, 26 };
        var result = ints.OrderBy(g => g);
        foreach (var i in result)
        {
            System.Console.Write(i + " ");
        }
    }
}
//Output: 10 15 21 26 39 45
…
The following is the extension method we have created.
public static int myExtensionMethod(this string str) {
   return Int32.Parse(str);
}
Let us see an example wherein we have used extension method.
using System;
using System.Text;
namespace Program {
   public static class Demo {
      public static int myExtensionMethod(this string str) {
         return Int32.Parse(str);
      }
   }
   class Program {
      static void Main(string[] args) {
         string str1 = "565";
         int n = str1.myExtensionMethod();
         Console.WriteLine("Result: {0}", n);
         Console.ReadLine();
      }
   }
}
Output
Result: 565

sealed      (GITHUB)	 (read)
Sealed nedir
Sealed bir access modifier değildir! Evet, bir modifier'dir. Ama access modifier değildir. Çünkü access'i yani erişimi değiştirmez, yani erişimi modifiye etmez.
Peki sealed tanımda ne olarak geçer?
Sealed bir modifier'dir.
Sealed daha genel anlamda bakıldığında bir keyword'dür tabi ki: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/
Sealed'in neden bir access modifier olmadığına dair güzel bir cevap: Cause if you cannot derive from a class it doesn't mean you cannot access it.
When applied to a class, the sealed modifier prevents other classes from inheriting from it. In the following example, class B inherits from class A, but no class can inherit from class B.
class A {}
sealed class B : A {}
Önemli: You can also use the sealed modifier on a method or property that overrides a virtual method or property in a base class. This enables you to allow classes to derive from your class and prevent them from overriding specific virtual methods or properties.
Example (gayet açık)
In the following example, Z inherits from Y but Z cannot override the virtual function F that is declared in X and sealed in Y.
class X
{
    protected virtual void F() { Console.WriteLine("X.F"); }
    protected virtual void F2() { Console.WriteLine("X.F2"); }
}

class Y : X
{
    sealed protected override void F() { Console.WriteLine("Y.F"); }
    protected override void F2() { Console.WriteLine("Y.F2"); }
}

class Z : Y
{
    // Attempting to override F causes compiler error CS0239.
    // protected override void F() { Console.WriteLine("Z.F"); }

    // Overriding F2 is allowed.
    protected override void F2() { Console.WriteLine("Z.F2"); }
}

When you define new methods or properties in a class, you can prevent deriving classes from overriding them by not declaring them as virtual.
It is an error to use the abstract modifier with a sealed class, because an abstract class must be inherited by a class that provides an implementation of the abstract methods or properties.
When applied to a method or property, the sealed modifier must always be used with override.
Because structs are implicitly sealed, they cannot be inherited.
For more information, see Inheritance.
For more examples, see Abstract and Sealed Classes and Class Members.
Example
sealed class SealedClass
{
    public int x;
    public int y;
}

class SealedTest2
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var sc = new SealedClass();
        sc.x = 110;
        sc.y = 150;
        Console.WriteLine($"x = {sc.x}, y = {sc.y}");
    }
}
// Output: x = 110, y = 150
In the previous example, you might try to inherit from the sealed class by using the following statement:
class MyDerivedC: SealedClass{} // Error
The result is an error message:
'MyDerivedC': cannot derive from sealed type 'SealedClass'
Remarks
To determine whether to seal a class, method, or property, you should generally consider the following two points:
•	The potential benefits that deriving classes might gain through the ability to customize your class.
•	The potential that deriving classes could modify your classes in such a way that they would no longer work correctly or as expected.

J# 		(GITHUB)	  (read)
J# nedir, jsharp nedir

Visual J# (pronounced "jay-sharp") is an implementation of the J# programming language that was a transitional language for programmers of Java and Visual J++ languages, so they could use their existing knowledge and applications with the .NET Framework.[1][2] It was introduced in 2002 and discontinued in 2007, with support for the final release of the product continuing until October 2017.
Fundamental differences between J# and Java
Java and J# use the same general syntax but there are non-Java conventions in J# to support the .NET environment. For example, to use .NET "properties" with a standard JavaBean class, it is necessary to prefix getter and setter methods with the Javadoc-like annotation:            /** @beanproperty   */ 
J# does not compile Java-language source code to Java bytecode.
JavaWorld said: "J#'s interface to the .NET framework is solid, but not as seamless as C#. In particular, J# code cannot define new .NET attributes, events, value types, or delegates. J# can make use of these language constructs if they are defined in an assembly written in another language, but its inability to define new ones limits J#'s reach and interoperability compared to other .NET languages."[5]

Memory Allocation	(GITHUB)   (read)
Memory Allocation nedir
What does Memory Allocation mean?
Memory allocation is a process by which computer programs and services are assigned with physical or virtual memory space.
Memory allocation is the process of reserving a partial or complete portion of computer memory for the execution of programs and processes. Memory allocation is achieved through a process known as memory management.
Memory allocation is primarily a computer hardware operation but is managed through operating system and software applications. Memory allocation process is quite similar in physical and virtual memory management. Programs and services are assigned with a specific memory as per their requirements when they are executed. Once the program has finished its operation or is idle, the memory is released and allocated to another program or merged within the primary memory.
Memory allocation has two core types;
Static Memory Allocation: The program is allocated memory at compile time.
Dynamic Memory Allocation: The programs are allocated with memory at run time.
