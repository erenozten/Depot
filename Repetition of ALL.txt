Kısayollar / Keyboard Shortcuts	(GITHUB) (asasas)
Kısayol nedir, shortcut nedir
-
KULLANMAYA ALIŞ BUNU: action’ın üzerine ctrl ile tıkla. Usage of Symbol’e tıklayınca action’ın kullanıldığı yerleri görebiliyosun. Mesela View’da kullanılmışsa bu action (httppost metoduysa misal) görebilirsin view’u hemen. Ctrl f yapıp action’ın kullanıldığı yere gitmene gerek yok.
Muhtemelen class vb için de kullanabiliriz bunu.
-
Return View();  view() üzerine ctrl ile tıklayınca view dosyasını açıyor
-
Ctrl-u  Sayfa kaynağını görüntülüyor CHROME

f2 - değişkene yeni isim ver (sistemdeki hepsinin)
ctrl alt f9  - breakpoint’e götürüyo seni

Ctrl  backspace    kelimeyi siliyo tamamen sola doğru
Ctrl  delete kelimeyi olduğu gibi siliyor. Sağa doğru siliyor. // ctrl + backspace de sola  doğru siliyor

ctrl + shift + nokta -> aynı değişkenlerin tümünü aynı anda editleme imkanı sağlıyor. (bende çalışmıyo)

Chrome offers “F5” key and the “Ctrl+R” key combination are used to reload the currently open Web page. 
Chrome also offers the reload shortcut combinations of “Ctrl + F5” and “Ctrl + Shift + R” to reload the currently open page and override the locally cached version.
Having cursor in the address field and pressing ENTER will also do the same as CTRL + F5
-Home, end (numpad’dakiler) : satırın başına ve sonuna gider. (shift ile de kullanılır, yazıyı seçmek için...)

-Klavyenin üstündeki normal home end tuşları: sayfanın başına ve sonuna gider.

-Numpad’daki home end tuşları ctrl ile kullanıldığında, tıpkı klavyenin üstündeki home-end tuşları gibi çalışıyor. Yani klavyenin üstündeki home-end tuşlarını kullanmaya gerek yok gibi görünüyor.

-Ctrl – yön tuşları  kelimenin başına sonuna gidiyor atlayarak.

-Next Error (F2) (çalışmadı)

-Previous error (Shift + F2) ) (çalışmadı)

-Expand Selection (Ctrl + W)

-Ctrl + n  search everywhere (acayip bişey) / create new file

- alt + yukarı aşağı arrows  iki satırın yerini birbiri arasında değiştirme.

- shift + alt  veya sadece alt-> kare alan seçme (çoklu satır)

Don’t use anything in the cache when making the request. Forces the browser to re-download every JavaScript file, image, text file, etc.
Empty Cache and Hard Reload
Empty Cache and hard reload = Empty the cache and Force the browser do re-download every JavaScript file, image, text file, etc.

Chrome kısayol: 
Crtl+F5 or Shift+F5 -> re-download cached content (i.e. JavaScript files, images, etc…)
Normal Reload
F5 or Control + R = Reload the current page
“Ctrl+R” is the same thing as pressing f5. This will use the cache in every way possible. If the browser can avoid re-downloading JavaScript files, images, text files, etc. then it will.
Note: Having cursor in the address field and pressing ENTER will also do the same as CTRL + F5
HARD RELOAD – NORMAL RELOAD nedir
Normal reload
The same thing as pressing F5. This will use the cache but revalidate everything during page load, looking for "304 Not Modified" responses. If the browser can avoid re-downloading cached JavaScript files, images, text files, etc. then it will.
________________________________________
Hard reload
Don't use anything in the cache when making the request. (which is equal to SHIFT+F5 No need to open Developer console) Force the browser do re-download every JavaScript file, image, text file, etc.
-

Hard reload / Force Refresh
Control + Shift + R or Control + F5 or Shift + F5 = ignoring cached content
Obviously if the cache is empty then it will have to do a hard reload in order to load the required/support files again. This will again force the browser to re-download everything. However, if the page makes any after the fact downloads via JavaScript that weren’t part of page load, then these might still use the cache, which is where emptying the cache helps because it makes sure that even these won’t use cached files.
RESHARPER:

Ctrl + T

Step over code to skip functions
When you are on a line of code that is a function or method call, you can press F10(Debug > Step Over) instead of F11.


Advance the debugger out of the current function
Sometimes, you might want to continue your debugging session but advance the debugger all the way through the current function.
Press Shift + F11 (or Debug > Step Out).
This command resumes app execution (and advances the debugger) until the current function returns.

F10 vs F11
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15584132/what-is-the-difference-between-f10-and-f11-keys-in-visual-studio/39843982
F10 ("step over") does not descend any further into the call stack. It moves to the next line of the current function.
F11 ("step into") drills down into the function being called.
void function1()
{
    function2();
    function3();
}
If you hit a breakpoint on function2(), F10 will advance to the line function3(). F11 will advance to the first line inside function2.

In mathematics, a tuple is a finite ordered list (sequence) of elements. An n-tuple is a sequence (or ordered list) of n elements, where n is a non-negative integer. There is only one 0-tuple, referred to as the empty tuple. An n-tuple is defined inductively using the construction of an ordered pair.

In mathematics, a tuple is a finite ordered list (sequence) of elements. An n-tuple is a sequence (or ordered list) of n elements, where n is a non-negative integer. There is only one 0-tuple, referred to as the empty tuple. An n-tuple is defined inductively using the construction of an ordered pair.
Mathematicians usually write tuples by listing the elements within parentheses "( )" and separated by commas; for example, (2, 7, 4, 1, 7) denotes a 5-tuple. Sometimes other symbols are used to surround the elements, such as square brackets "[ ]" or angle brackets "⟨ ⟩". Braces "{ }" are only used in defining arrays in some programming languages but not in mathematical expressions, as they are the standard notation for sets. The term tuple can often occur when discussing other mathematical objects, such as vectors.
In computer science, tuples come in many forms. Most typed functional programming languages implement tuples directly as product types,[1] tightly associated with algebraic data types, pattern matching, and destructuring assignment.[2] Many programming languages offer an alternative to tuples, known as record types, featuring unordered elements accessed by label.[3] A few programming languages combine ordered tuple product types and unordered record types into a single construct, as in C structs and Haskell records. Relational databases may formally identify their rows (records) as tuples.
Tuples also occur in relational algebra; when programming the semantic web with the Resource Description Framework (RDF); in linguistics;[4] and in philosophy.[5]

CakePHP	(GITHUB)  (test) 
Cakephp nedir
Pastanın katmanlarını düşün, ismi oradan geliyor. Model view controller katmanları…
CakePHP is an open-source web framework. It follows the model–view–controller (MVC) approach and is written in PHP, modeled after the concepts of Ruby on Rails, and distributed under the MIT License.
CakePHP uses well-known software engineering concepts and software design patterns, such as convention over configuration, model–view–controller, active record, association data mapping, and front controller.
CakePHP started in April 2005, when a Polish programmer Michal Tatarynowicz[3] wrote a minimal version of a rapid application development framework in PHP, dubbing it Cake. He published the framework under the MIT license, and opened it up to the online community of developers. In December 2005, L. Masters and G. J. Woodworth founded the Cake Software Foundation to promote development related to CakePHP.[6] Version 1.0 was released in May 2006.
One of the project's inspirations was Ruby on Rails, using many of its concepts. The community has since grown and spawned several sub-projects.

BCPL		(bosch)	 (bosch)
bcpl nedir
BCPL ("Basic Combined Programming Language") is a procedural, imperative, and structured programming language. Originally intended for writing compilers for other languages, BCPL is no longer in common use. However, its influence is still felt because a stripped down and syntactically changed version of BCPL, called B, was the language on which the C programming language was based. BCPL introduced several features of many modern programming languages, including using curly braces to delimit code blocks. BCPL was first implemented by Martin Richards of the University of Cambridge in 1967.
The book BCPL: The language and its compiler describes the philosophy of BCPL as follows:
"The philosophy of BCPL is not one of the tyrant who thinks he knows best and lays down the law on what is and what is not allowed; rather, BCPL acts more as a servant offering his services to the best of his ability without complaint, even when confronted with apparent nonsense. The programmer is always assumed to know what he is doing and is not hemmed in by petty restrictions."

Go / Golang	(GITHUB)  (test) 
go nedir, golang nedir

Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google[14] by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.[12] Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing,[6] and CSP-style concurrency.[15] The language is often referred to as "Golang" because of its domain name, golang.org, but the proper name is Go.[16]
There are two major implementations:
•	Google's self-hosting[17] compiler toolchain targeting multiple operating systems, mobile devices,[18] and WebAssembly.[19]
•	gccgo, a GCC frontend.[20][21]
A third-party transpiler GopherJS[22] compiles Go to JavaScript for front-end web development.

Smalltalk	(edited) (test)
smalltalk nedir
Xerox PARC'ta (Palo Alto Research Center) geliştirilmiş nesne yönelimli bir programlama dilidir.
Definition - What does Smalltalk mean?
Smalltalk is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language that incorporates dynamic runtime typing methodology and maneuverability.

Mostly used for application modeling, Smalltalk was created based on basic object principles, which dictate that each thing is an object, and each object can communicate with other objects.

Smalltalk was initially released as version Smalltalk-80 in the 1970s by the Learning Research Group at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center Inc.
Techopedia explains Smalltalk
Because Smalltalk is dynamic and does not require variable type declarations, processing is determined by the receiving object. Type checking is performed at run time, rather than compiling time. Smalltalk also offers tremendous runtime application modification and maneuverability, which extends to syntax or the integrated development environment (IDE).

The central concept in Smalltalk is an object, which is an instance of a class. The three operations performed by a Smalltalk object are:
•	Receive messages from itself or other objects
•	Send messages to itself or another object
•	Reference other objects.
Messaging is the most important concept in Smalltalk. Upon receiving a message, the receiver determines whether it is appropriate. A message can be sent to any object. Other objects can query the state only by sending messages to the object. The language construct in Smalltalk are messages. By default, Smalltalk uses a synchronous, single dynamic message dispatch strategy. Expressions in Smalltalk include multiple message send.

Smalltalk considers primitive values such as integers, Booleans and characters as objects because they are instances of corresponding classes, and operations on them are invoked by sending messages. A programmer can change the classes that implement primitive values to define new behavior for their instances. Classes and code blocks are objects in Smalltalk. Each class is an instance of the metaclass of that class where metaclasses are also objec

Look And Feel          (GITHUB)  (test) 
Look and feel nedir
In software design, the look and feel of a graphical user interface comprises aspects of its design, including elements such as colors, shapes, layout, and typefaces (the "look"), as well as the behavior of dynamic elements such as buttons, boxes, and menus (the "feel"). The term can also refer to aspects of a non-graphical user interface (such as a command-line interface), as well as to aspects of an API – mostly to parts of an API that are not related to its functional properties. The term is used in reference to both software and websites.
Look and feel applies to other products. In documentation, for example, it refers to the graphical layout (document size, color, font, etc.) and the writing style. In the context of equipment, it refers to consistency in controls and displays across a product line.
Look and feel in operating system user interfaces serves two general purposes. First, it provides branding, helping to identify a set of products from one company. Second, it increases ease of use, since users will become familiar with how one product functions (looks, reads, etc.) and can translate their experience to other products with the same look and feel.

JPA / Java Persistence API   	(GITHUB) (test)
Jpa nedir

The Java ORM standard for storing, accessing, and managing Java objects in a relational database.
As a specification, the Java Persistence API is concerned with persistence, which loosely means any mechanism by which Java objects outlive the application process that created them. Not all Java objects need to be persisted, but most applications persist key business objects. The JPA specification lets you define which objects should be persisted, and how those objects should be persisted in your Java applications.
By itself, JPA is not a tool or framework; rather, it defines a set of concepts that can be implemented by any tool or framework. While JPA's object-relational mapping (ORM) model was originally based on Hibernate, it has since evolved. Likewise, while JPA was originally intended for use with relational/SQL databases, some JPA implementations have been extended for use with NoSQL datastores. A popular framework that supports JPA with NoSQL is EclipseLink, the reference implementation for JPA 2.2.
The Java Persistence API was first released as a subset of the EJB 3.0 specification (JSR 220) in Java EE 5. It has since evolved as its own spec, starting with the release of JPA 2.0 in Java EE 6 (JSR 317). As of this writing, JPA 2.2 has been adopted for continuation as part of Jakarta EE.
JPA and Hibernate
Because of their intertwined history, Hibernate and JPA are frequently conflated. However, like the Java Servlet specification, JPA has spawned many compatible tools and frameworks; Hibernate is just one of them.
What is Java ORM?
While they differ in execution, every JPA implementation provides some kind of ORM layer. In order to understand JPA and JPA-compatible tools, you need to have a good grasp on ORM.
Object-relational mapping is a task–one that developers have good reason to avoid doing manually. A framework like Hibernate ORM or EclipseLink codifies that task into a library or framework, an ORM layer. As part of the application architecture, the ORM layer is responsible for managing the conversion of software objects to interact with the tables and columns in a relational database. In Java, the ORM layer converts Java classes and objects so that they can be stored and managed in a relational database.
[ Learn Java from beginning concepts to advanced design patterns in this comprehensive 12-part course! ]
By default, the name of the object being persisted becomes the name of the table, and fields become columns. Once the table is set up, each table row corresponds to an object in the application. Object mapping is configurable, but defaults tend to work well.
JPA with NoSQL
Until fairly recently, non-relational databases were uncommon curiosities. The NoSQL movement changed all that, and now a variety of NoSQL databases are available to Java developers. Some JPA implementations have evolved to embrace NoSQL, including Hibernate OGM and EclipseLink.
