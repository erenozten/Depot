Overload / Method overloading  	(GITHUB)
overload nedir, overloading nedir, method overloading nedir

Method Overloading is the common way of implementing polymorphism. It is the ability to redefine a function in more than one form. A user can implement function overloading by defining two or more functions in a class sharing the same name. C# can distinguish the methods with different method signatures. i.e. the methods can have the same name but with different parameters list (i.e. the number of the parameters, order of the parameters, and data types of the parameters) within the same class.
•	Overloaded methods are differentiated based on the number and type of the parameters passed as arguments to the methods.
•	You can not define more than one method with the same name, Order and the type of the arguments. It would be compiler error.
•	The compiler does not consider the return type while differentiating the overloaded method. But you cannot declare two methods with the same signature and different return type. It will throw a compile-time error. If both methods have the same parameter types, but different return type, then it is not possible.
Why do we need Method Overloading ??
If we need to do the same kind of the operation in different ways i.e. for different inputs. In the example described below, we are doing the addition operation for different inputs. It is hard to find many different meaningful names for single action.
Different ways of doing overloading methods-
Method overloading can be done by changing:
1.	The number of parameters in two methods.
2.	The data types of the parameters of methods.
3.	The Order of the parameters of methods.


using System; 
class GFG { 
    // adding two integer values. 
    public int Add(int a, int b) 
    { 
        int sum = a + b; 
        return sum; 
    } 
  
    // adding three integer values. 
    public int Add(int a, int b, int c) 
    { 
        int sum = a + b + c; 
        return sum; 
    } 
  
    // Main Method 
    public static void Main(String[] args) 
    { 
        // Creating Object 
        GFG ob = new GFG(); 
        int sum1 = ob.Add(1, 2); 
        Console.WriteLine("sum of the two "
                          + "integer value : " + sum1); 
  
        int sum2 = ob.Add(1, 2, 3); 
        Console.WriteLine("sum of the three "
                          + "integer value : " + sum2); 
    } 
} 
Output:
sum of the two integer value : 3
sum of the three integer value : 6

    } 
} 
Output:
Name : Akku, Id : 1
Name : Abby, Id : 2

What happens when method signature is same and the return type is different?
The compiler will give error as the return value alone is not sufficient for the compiler to figure out which function it has to call. Only if both methods have different parameter types (so, they have the different signature), then Method overloading is possible.

Example:

using System; 
class GFG { 
    // adding two integer value. 
    public int Add(int a, int b) 
    { 
  
        int sum = a + b; 
        return sum; 
    } 
  
    // adding three integer value. 
    public double Add(int a, int b) 
    { 
        double sum = a + b + 0.0; 
        return sum; 
    } 
  
    // Main Method 
    public static void Main(String[] args) 
    { 
        // Creating Object 
        GFG ob = new GFG(); 
  
        int sum1 = ob.Add(1, 2); 
        Console.WriteLine("sum of the two "
                          + "integer value :" + sum1); 
  
        int sum2 = ob.Add(1, 2); 
        Console.WriteLine("sum of the three "
                          + "integer value :" + sum2); 
    } 
} 
Compile Time Error:
prog.cs(15,19): error CS0111: A member `GFG.Add(int, int)’ is already defined. Rename this member or use different parameter types

integral type nedir, integral types nedir, Integral type nedir, Integral types nedir
Adına dikkat et zaten ne olduğu belli oluyor etimolojisinden: Integral -> Integer
The integral numeric types represent integer numbers. All integral numeric types are value types. They are also simple types and can be initialized with literals. All integral numeric types support arithmetic, bitwise logical, comparison, and equality operators.
Characteristics of the integral types
C# supports the following predefined integral types:
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INTEGRAL TYPES
C# type/keyword	Range	Size	.NET type
sbyte	-128 to 127	Signed 8-bit integer	System.SByte

byte	0 to 255	Unsigned 8-bit integer	System.Byte

short	-32,768 to 32,767	Signed 16-bit integer	System.Int16

ushort	0 to 65,535	Unsigned 16-bit integer	System.UInt16

int	-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647	Signed 32-bit integer	System.Int32

uint	0 to 4,294,967,295	Unsigned 32-bit integer	System.UInt32

long	-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807	Signed 64-bit integer	System.Int64

ulong	0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615	Unsigned 64-bit integer	System.UInt64

In the preceding table, each C# type keyword from the leftmost column is an alias for the corresponding .NET type. They are interchangeable. For example, the following declarations declare variables of the same type:
int a = 123;
System.Int32 b = 123;
The default value of each integral type is zero, 0. Each of the integral types has the MinValue and MaxValue constants that provide the minimum and maximum value of that type.
Use the System.Numerics.BigInteger structure to represent a signed integer with no upper or lower bounds.
Integer literals
Integer literals can be
•	decimal: without any prefix
•	hexadecimal: with the 0x or 0X prefix
•	binary: with the 0b or 0B prefix (available in C# 7.0 and later)
The following code demonstrates an example of each:
var decimalLiteral = 42;
var hexLiteral = 0x2A;
var binaryLiteral = 0b_0010_1010;
The preceding example also shows the use of _ as a digit separator, which is supported starting with C# 7.0. You can use the digit separator with all kinds of numeric literals.

The type of an integer literal is determined by its suffix as follows:
•	If the literal has no suffix, its type is the first of the following types in which its value can be represented: int, uint, long, ulong.
•	If the literal is suffixed by U or u, its type is the first of the following types in which its value can be represented: uint, ulong.
•	If the literal is suffixed by L or l, its type is the first of the following types in which its value can be represented: long, ulong.
 Note
You can use the lowercase letter l as a suffix. However, this generates a compiler warning because the letter l can be confused with the digit 1. Use L for clarity.
•	If the literal is suffixed by UL, Ul, uL, ul, LU, Lu, lU, or lu, its type is ulong.
If the value represented by an integer literal exceeds UInt64.MaxValue, a compiler error CS1021 occurs.
If the determined type of an integer literal is int and the value represented by the literal is within the range of the destination type, the value can be implicitly converted to sbyte, byte, short, ushort, uint, or ulong:
byte a = 17;
byte b = 300;   // CS0031: Constant value '300' cannot be converted to a 'byte'
As the preceding example shows, if the literal's value is not within the range of the destination type, a compiler error CS0031 occurs.
You can also use a cast to convert the value represented by an integer literal to the type other than the determined type of the literal:
var signedByte = (sbyte)42;
var longVariable = (long)42;










TryParse  	(GITHUB)
tryparse nedir

TryParse(String, Int32)	
Yukarıda TryParse metodunun parametrelerini görüyoruz. İlk parametresi string alıyormuş, diğeri ise int değer…
Yapısı ise şöyle:
public static bool TryParse (string s, out int result);

Yani ilk parametre olan string değerini alıyor, OUT ile bunu int'e çevirmeye çalışıyor.
Yani tryparse STRING'I INT'E ÇEVİRMEYE ÇALIŞIR.
Converts the string representation of a number to its 32-bit signed integer equivalent. A return value indicates whether the conversion succeeded.


Using TryParse
The most common and most recommended way of parsing an integer string is to use the TryParse static method on the Int32 type as follows:
string intString = "234";
int i = 0;
if (!Int32.TryParse(intString, out i))
{
   i = -1;
}
return i;
Using TryParse with Nullable Integer
When the above example fails to parse the string as a valid integer, you can see that we just set it to -1. This doesn't work too well if -1 one is a meaningful value in your program. Instead, we could parse the string and return a nullable int where the null value indicates that the input string was not a valid integer.
private int? ConvertStringToInt(string intString)
{
   int i=0;
   return (Int32.TryParse(intString, out i) ? i : (int?)null);
}
Using Convert
There is yet another way to parse a string to an integer which uses the Convert method, but this is a little less convenient than the previous example because we have to manage exceptions if something goes wrong. Exceptions are also expensive to throw so you don't generally want these to be an expected part of the flow of your program. This is especially true if the exceptions are throwing in a loop where there is the potential for a lot of them. This could really slow down your program. You'd be better in that case to use TryParse or maybe even Regex to validate the string is in the form you desire before trying the conversion.
int i = 0;
try
{
   i = System.Convert.ToInt32(intString);
}
catch (FormatException)
{
   // the FormatException is thrown when the string text does 
   // not represent a valid integer.
}
catch (OverflowException)
{
   // the OverflowException is thrown when the string is a valid integer, 
   // but is too large for a 32 bit integer.  Use Convert.ToInt64 in
   // this case.
}
There are benefits to using Convert over TryParse when you need to know why the parsing failed.
Also unlike the TryParse method, the Convert method has many overloads which allow you to convert almost any type to an integer. Here are just a few examples:
int i = 0;

// bool to Int32
bool b = true;
i = Convert.ToInt32(b);

// byte to Int32
byte bt = 3;
i = Convert.ToInt32(bt);

// char to Int32
char c = 'A';
i = Convert.ToInt32(c);

// DateTime to Int32
DateTime dt = DateTime.Now;
i = Convert.ToInt32(dt);

// Decimal to Int32
decimal d = 25.678m;
i = Convert.ToInt32(d);

// double to Int32
double db = 0.007234;
i = Convert.ToInt32(db);
That's just a few of the 19 or so different overloads for the Convert method. For all of them visit the MSDN documentation on Convert.ToInt32.

Type Casting	GITHUB)
Type casting nedir, casting nedir, convert nedir
Type casting is when you assign a value of one data type to another type.
Örnek:
       public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            double x = 1234.7;
            int a;

            // Cast double to int.
            a = (int)x;

            Console.WriteLine(a);

            
            double newDouble;
            int newInt = 42;

            //newDouble = (double)newInt; //redundant casting.. Gereksiz... Şöyle yazılır kısaca:
            newDouble = newInt;

            //bool u inte e cast etmeyi deneyelim:

            bool newBool1 = true;
            int asd;

            //asd = Convert.ToInt32(newBool1); // always true. yani çalıştı

            asd = Convert.ToInt32(newBool1); // always true. çalıştı

            //asd = (int)newBool1; // HATA

            int newInt2 = 20;

           //alttaki ikisi arasında ne fark var?
            string as3 = Convert.ToString(newInt2);

            string as4 = newInt2.ToString();
            
            //The basic difference between them is the Convert function handles NULLS while i.ToString () does not; it will throw a NULL reference exception error. So as good coding practice using convert is always safe.

            Console.ReadLine();
        }
In C#, there are two types of casting:
•	Implicit Casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size
char -> int -> long -> float -> double

•	Explicit Casting (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type
double -> float -> long -> int -> char
Implicit Casting
Implicit casting is done automatically when passing a smaller size type to a larger size type:
Example
int myInt = 9;
double myDouble = myInt;       // Automatic casting: int to double

Console.WriteLine(myInt);      // Outputs 9
Console.WriteLine(myDouble);   // Outputs 9
Run example »
________________________________________
Explicit Casting
Explicit casting must be done manually by placing the type in parentheses in front of the value:
Example
double myDouble = 9.78;
int myInt = (int) myDouble;    // Manual casting: double to int

Console.WriteLine(myDouble);   // Outputs 9.78
Console.WriteLine(myInt);      // Outputs 9

nullable bool and others
You typically use a nullable value type when you need to represent the undefined value of an underlying value type. For example, a Boolean, or bool, variable can only be either true or false. However, in some applications a variable value can be undefined or missing. For example, a database field may contain true or false, or it may contain no value at all, that is, NULL. You can use the bool? type in that scenario.
The default value of a nullable value type represents null, that is, it's an instance whose Nullable<T>.HasValue property returns false.
(as we know, represent means: be entitled or appointed to act or speak for (someone), especially in an official capacity.)
Nullable<int> n1 = new Nullable<int>(10);
private int n2 = new int();
int? n3 ;
int? n4 = null;

string s1 = new string("qqq");
--
Loop

            int val1 = 0;
            for (; val1 < 11; val1++)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(val1);
            }

Object Oriented Programming / OOP / NYP
oop nedir, object oriented programming nedir, nyp nedir

Object oriented prensipleri nelerdir ? JAVA
Encapsulation  : Değişkenler private yapı larak get.. ve set.. metodlarıylaerişilir
Abstraction  : Gereksiz ayrıntı lar kullanıcıya sunulmaz
Inheritance    :  Bir  sını fın  özellikleri  extend  anahtar  kelimesiyle  miras alınır.
Polymorphism  :  Runtime  sırasında  oluşturulan  sını fın  metodununçağrı lmasıdır.[4],[5]

Nesne yönelimli programlama (NYP), (İngilizce: Object - Oriented Programming)(OOP), Her işlevin nesneler olarak soyutlandığı bir programlama yaklaşımıdır. NYP destekleyen programlama dilleri yüksek seviye diller olarak adlandırılır.

NYP'dan önceki uygulamaların bakım maliyeti ve karmaşıklık ilişkisi
NYP'dan önceki uygulamaların bakım maliyeti ve karmaşıklık ilişkisi
1960'lı yılların sonuna doğru ortaya çıkan bu yaklaşım, o dönemin yazılım dünyasında beliren bir bunalımın sonucudur. Yazılımların karmaşıklığı ve boyutları sürekli artıyor, ancak belli bir nitelik düzeyi korumak için gereken bakımın maliyeti zaman ve çaba olarak daha da hızlı artıyordu. NYP'yi bu soruna karşı bir çözüm haline getiren başlıca özelliği, yazılımda birimselliği (modularity) benimsemesidir. NYP ayrıca, bilgi gizleme (information hiding), veri soyutlama (data abstraction), çok biçimlilik (polymorphism) ve kalıtım (inheritance) gibi yazılımın bakımını ve aynı yazılım üzerinde birden fazla kişinin çalışmasını kolaylaştıran kavramları da yazılım literatürüne kazandırmıştır. Sağladığı bu avantajlardan dolayı, NYP günümüzde geniş çaplı yazılım projelerinde yaygın olarak kullanılmaktadır.

NYP'nin altında yatan birimselliğin ana fikri, her bilgisayar programının (izlence), etkileşim içerisinde olan birimler veya nesneler kümesinden oluştuğu varsayımıdır. Bu nesnelerin her biri, kendi içerisinde veri işleyebilir, ve diğer nesneler ile çift yönlü veri alışverişinde bulunabilir. Hâlbuki NYP'den önce var olan tek yaklaşımda (Yordamsal programlama), programlar sadece bir komut dizisi veya birer işlev (fonksiyon) kümesi olarak görülmektedirler.

Günümüzde çok çeşitli nesne tabanlı programlama dilleri olmasıyla beraber, en popüler diller sınıflar üzerine kurulmuşlardır (class-based). Bu dillerde nesneler sınıfların birer üyesidir ve nesnelerin tipini de bu sınıflar belirlerler.

En yaygın NYP dillerinden bazıları, Python, C++, Objective-C, Smalltalk, Delphi, Java, Swift, C#, Perl, Ruby ve PHP' dir.
Nesne yönelimli programlama dilleri yukarıda adı geçen tüm ögelere sahip olurken, Ada, JavaScript, Visual Basic gibi nesne tabanlı programlama dilleri birkaçından yoksundur, bu dillerin başlıca yoksunluğu kalıtıma sahip olmamalarıdır.

Nesneler ve sınıflar
NYP'yi destekleyen programlama dilleri genellikle tekrar kullanım ve genişletilebilirlik açısından, prototipler ve sınıflar şeklinde kod kalıtımına sahiptirler ve NYP deki nesneler kimi zaman gerçek dünyada bulunan şeylere karşılık gelebilir. Mesela bir grafik programı "kare", "üçgen" ve "yuvarlak" gibi nesnelere sahip olabilir. Bazen nesneler daha soyut şeyleri de temsil edebilirler, mesela bir hesap makinesi programı logaritma almanızı ya da metreyi fite çevirmenizi sağlayacak nesnelere sahip olabilir. İşte bu bahsi geçen nesneler belli sınıflar altında bulunurlar, mesela "Kasım" adında bir nesne Aylar sınıfının bir üyesi olabilir ya da "Faktöriyel" olarak isimlendirilmiş bir nesne Fonksiyonlar sınıfında yer alıyor olabilir.

Git		(GITHUB)
git nedir

By far, the most widely used modern version control system in the world today is Git. Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel. A staggering number of software projects rely on Git for version control, including commercial projects as well as open source. Developers who have worked with Git are well represented in the pool of available software development talent and it works well on a wide range of operating systems and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).

Having a distributed architecture, Git is an example of a DVCS (hence Distributed Version Control System). Rather than have only one single place for the full version history of the software as is common in once-popular version control systems like CVS or Subversion (also known as SVN), in Git, every developer's working copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full history of all changes.

In addition to being distributed, Git has been designed with performance, security and flexibility in mind.

Performance
The raw performance characteristics of Git are very strong when compared to many alternatives. Committing new changes, branching, merging and comparing past versions are all optimized for performance. The algorithms implemented inside Git take advantage of deep knowledge about common attributes of real source code file trees, how they are usually modified over time and what the access patterns are.

Unlike some version control software, Git is not fooled by the names of the files when determining what the storage and version history of the file tree should be, instead, Git focuses on the file content itself. After all, source code files are frequently renamed, split, and rearranged. The object format of Git's repository files uses a combination of delta encoding (storing content differences), compression and explicitly stores directory contents and version metadata objects.

Being distributed enables significant performance benefits as well.

For example, say a developer, Alice, makes changes to source code, adding a feature for the upcoming 2.0 release, then commits those changes with descriptive messages. She then works on a second feature and commits those changes too. Naturally these are stored as separate pieces of work in the version history. Alice then switches to the version 1.3 branch of the same software to fix a bug that affects only that older version. The purpose of this is to enable Alice's team to ship a bug fix release, version 1.3.1, before version 2.0 is ready. Alice can then return to the 2.0 branch to continue working on new features for 2.0 and all of this can occur without any network access and is therefore fast and reliable. She could even do it on an airplane. When she is ready to send all of the individually committed changes to the remote repository, Alice can "push" them in one command.

Security
Git has been designed with the integrity of managed source code as a top priority. The content of the files as well as the true relationships between files and directories, versions, tags and commits, all of these objects in the Git repository are secured with a cryptographically secure hashing algorithm called SHA1. This protects the code and the change history against both accidental and malicious change and ensures that the history is fully traceable.

With Git, you can be sure you have an authentic content history of your source code.

Some other version control systems have no protections against secret alteration at a later date. This can be a serious information security vulnerability for any organization that relies on software development.

Flexibility
One of Git's key design objectives is flexibility. Git is flexible in several respects: in support for various kinds of nonlinear development workflows, in its efficiency in both small and large projects and in its compatibility with many existing systems and protocols.

Git has been designed to support branching and tagging as first-class citizens (unlike SVN) and operations that affect branches and tags (such as merging or reverting) are also stored as part of the change history. Not all version control systems feature this level of tracking.

Version control with Git
Git is the best choice for most software teams today. While every team is different and should do their own analysis, here are the main reasons why version control with Git is preferred over alternatives:

Git is good
Git has the functionality, performance, security and flexibility that most teams and individual developers need. These attributes of Git are detailed above. In side-by-side comparisons with most other alternatives, many teams find that Git is very favorable.

Git is a de facto standard
Git is the most broadly adopted tool of its kind. This is makes Git attractive for the following reasons. At Atlassian, nearly all of our project source code is managed in Git.

Vast numbers of developers already have Git experience and a significant proportion of college graduates may have experience with only Git. While some organizations may need to climb the learning curve when migrating to Git from another version control system, many of their existing and future developers do not need to be trained on Git.

In addition to the benefits of a large talent pool, the predominance of Git also means that many third party software tools and services are already integrated with Git including IDEs, and our own tools like DVCS desktop client Sourcetree, issue and project tracking software, Jira, and code hosting service, Bitbucket.

If you are an inexperienced developer wanting to build up valuable skills in software development tools, when it comes to version control, Git should be on your list.

Git is a quality open source project
Git is a very well supported open source project with over a decade of solid stewardship. The project maintainers have shown balanced judgment and a mature approach to meeting the long term needs of its users with regular releases that improve usability and functionality. The quality of the open source software is easily scrutinized and countless businesses rely heavily on that quality.

Git enjoys great community support and a vast user base. Documentation is excellent and plentiful, including books, tutorials and dedicated web sites. There are also podcasts and video tutorials.

Being open source lowers the cost for hobbyist developers as they can use Git without paying a fee. For use in open-source projects, Git is undoubtedly the successor to the previous generations of successful open source version control systems, SVN and CVS.

Criticism of Git
One common criticism of Git is that it can be difficult to learn. Some of the terminology in Git will be novel to newcomers and for users of other systems, the Git terminology may be different, for example, revert in Git has a different meaning than in SVN or CVS. Nevertheless, Git is very capable and provides a lot of power to its users. Learning to use that power can take some time, however once it has been learned, that power can be used by the team to increase their development speed.

For those teams coming from a non-distributed VCS, having a central repository may seem like a good thing that they don't want to lose. However, while Git has been designed as a distributed version control system (DVCS), with Git, you can still have an official, canonical repository where all changes to the software must be stored. With Git, because each developer's repository is complete, their work doesn't need to be constrained by the availability and performance of the "central" server. During outages or while offline, developers can still consult the full project history. Because Git is flexible as well as being distributed, you can work the way you are accustomed to but gain the additional benefits of Git, some of which you may not even realise you're missing.

Now that you understand what version control is, what Git is and why software teams should use it, read on to discover the benefits Git can provide across the whole organization.

Compiler / Derleyici  (GITHUB) (örnek)
compiler nedir, derleyici nedir
Programcılıkta, bir programlama dilinde yazılmış olan kaynak kodunu başka bir dile (genellikle makine koduna) çeviren yazılım. Derleyiciye bunu yaptırmaktaki amaç genellikle çalışabilir bir yazılım elde etmektir. Kullanıcıların programları kullanırken kolaylık sağlamak amaçlı geliştirilmiştir... Örneğin, şu satırı bir programın kaynak kodunda (programın okunabilir hali) düşünelim:
 
Alttaki assembly'de yazılmış satırlar, aynı programın derlenmiş halidir:

LOAD A [0]        ;; belleğin 0 adresindeki veriyi A siciline yükle 

ADD  A BX         ;; A siciline BX sicilindeki adreste bulunan veriyi ekle 

STOR A [100]      ;; sonucu 100 adresine yaz

Bu örnekte çevirinin hedefi, programcının anladığı kaynak kodundan işlemcinin anladığı 0 ile 1 den oluşan makine dili kodunu üretmek (LOAD,ADD ve STOR komutları 0001, 0011 ve 0010 olarak yorumlanır)

 0001 01 00 00000000

In computing, a compiler is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another language (the target language). The name "compiler" is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language (e.g., assembly language, object code, or machine code) to create an executable program.[1][2]:p1

However, there are many different types of compilers. If the compiled program can run on a computer whose CPU or operating system is different from the one on which the compiler runs, the compiler is a cross-compiler. A bootstrap compiler is written in the language that it intends to compile. A program that translates from a low-level language to a higher level one is a decompiler. A program that translates between high-level languages is usually called a source-to-source compiler or transcompiler. A language rewriter is usually a program that translates the form of expressions without a change of language. The term compiler-compiler refers to tools used to create parsers that perform syntax analysis.

A compiler is likely to perform many or all of the following operations: preprocessing, lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis (syntax-directed translation), conversion of input programs to an intermediate representation, code optimization and code generation. Compilers implement these operations in phases that promote efficient design and correct transformations of source input to target output. Program faults caused by incorrect compiler behavior can be very difficult to track down and work around; therefore, compiler implementers invest significant effort to ensure compiler correctness.[3]

Compilers are not the only language processor used to transform source programs. An interpreter is computer software that transforms and then executes the indicated operations.[2]:p2 The translation process influences the design of computer languages, which leads to a preference of compilation or interpretation. In practice, an interpreter can be implemented for compiled languages and compilers can be implemented for interpreted languages.

A diagram of the operation of a typical multi-language, multi-target compiler
A diagram of the operation of a typical multi-language, multi-target compiler
Theoretical computing concepts developed by scientists, mathematicians, and engineers formed the basis of digital modern computing development during World War II. Primitive binary languages evolved because digital devices only understand ones and zeros and the circuit patterns in the underlying machine architecture. In the late 1940s, assembly languages were created to offer a more workable abstraction of the computer architectures. Limited memory capacity of early computers led to substantial technical challenges when the first compilers were designed. Therefore, the compilation process needed to be divided into several small programs. The front end programs produce the analysis products used by the back end programs to generate target code. As computer technology provided more resources, compiler designs could align better with the compilation process.

It is usually more productive for a programmer to use a high-level language, so the development of high-level languages followed naturally from the capabilities offered by digital computers. High-level languages are formal languages that are strictly defined by their syntax and semantics which form the high-level language architecture. Elements of these formal languages include:

Alphabet, any finite set of symbols;
String, a finite sequence of symbols;
Language, any set of strings on an alphabet.
The sentences in a language may be defined by a set of rules called a grammar.

Polymorphism
Polymorphism nedir?
Polymorphism is often referred to as the third pillar of object-oriented programming, after encapsulation and inheritance. Polymorphism is a Greek word that means "many-shaped" and it has two distinct aspects.
•	At run time, objects of a derived class may be treated as objects of a base class in places such as method parameters and collections or arrays. When this occurs, the object's declared type is no longer identical to its run-time type.
•	Base classes may define and implement virtual methods, and derived classes can override them, which means they provide their own definition and implementation. At run-time, when client code calls the method, the CLR looks up the run-time type of the object, and invokes that override of the virtual method. Thus in your source code you can call a method on a base class, and cause a derived class's version of the method to be executed.

The word polymorphism means having many forms. In object-oriented programming paradigm, polymorphism is often expressed as 'one interface, multiple functions'.
Polymorphism can be static or dynamic. In static polymorphism, the response to a function is determined at the compile time. In dynamic polymorphism, it is decided at run-time.


Instance Method = Non Static Method
Instance method nedir, instance method nedir, non static method nedir, non-static method nedir
Instance method bildiğin class'ın instance'ının sahip olduğu, bildiğimiz metodlardır. Static olmayan, bildiğimiz klasik metotlar.
Static Method	Non Static Method (Instance Method)
1. Static method is defined with the static keyword.	1. Non Static Method is defined without static keyword.
2. Static method is called by its class name	2. Non Static Method is called by making the object of a class.
3. We can’t use this keyword inside the Static Method	3. We can use thiskeyword inside Non Static Method
4. Static Method uses the memory of Class	4. Non Static Method uses a memory of an object


Instance method are methods which require an object of its class to be created before it can be called. To invoke a instance method, we have to create an Object of the class in within which it defined.
public void geek(String name)
{
 // code to be executed....
}
// Return type can be int, float String or user defined data type.
Memory allocation: These methods themselves are stored in Permanent Generation space of heap but the parameters (arguments passed to them) and their local variables and the value to be returned are allocated in stack. They can be called within the same class in which they reside or from the different classes defined either in the same package or other packages depend on the access type provided to the desired instance method.

Important Points:
•	Instance method(s) belong to the Object of the class not to the class i.e. they can be called after creating the Object of the class.
•	Every individual Object created from the class has its own copy of the instance method(s) of that class.
•	Instance methods are not stored on a per-instance basis, even with virtual methods. They’re stored in a single memory location, and they only “know” which object they belong to because the this pointer is passed when you call them.
•	They can be overridden since they are resolved using dynamic binding at run time. (dynamic binding'in runtime'da yapıldığını öğrenmiştik. metoda verilen argument'lerin zaten runtime'da değiştirilebildiğini biliyoruz.Yani buradan zaten bu sonuca kendimiz de varabiliriz: Bu bir Dynamic Binding olayıdır.


When to use static methods ??
•	When you have code that can be shared across all instances of the same class, put that portion of code into static method.
•	They are basically used to access static field(s) of the class.
 Instance method vs Static method
•	Instance method can access the instance methods and instance variables directly.
•	Instance method can access static variables and static methods directly.
•	Static methods can access the static variables and static methods directly.
•	Static methods can’t access instance methods and instance variables directly. They must use reference to object. And static method can’t use this keyword as there is no instance for ‘this’ to refer to.

Static Method nedir? (GITHUB)
Static method nedir

A static method in C# is a method that keeps only one copy of the method at the Type level, not the object level. That means, all instances of the class share the same copy of the method and its data. The last updated value of the method is shared among all objects of that Type. 

Static methods are called by using the class name, not the instance of the class. 
 
The Console class and its Read and Write methods are an example of static methods. The following code example calls Console.WriteLine and Console.ReadKey methods without creating an instance of the Console class. 
C# supports two types of class methods, static methods, and non static methods. Any normal method is a non static method. 
1.	class Program  
2.	{  
3.	    public static void withoutObj()  
4.	    {  
5.	        Console.WriteLine("Hello");  
6.	    }  
7.	     static void Main()  
8.	    {  
9.	        Program. withoutObj();  
10.	        Console.ReadKey();  
11.	    }  
12.	}  

Using Static Method
Usually we define a set of data members for a class and then every object of that class will have a separate copy of each of those data members. Let's have an example.
1.	class Program  
2.	  {  
3.	      public int myVar;  //a non-static field  
4.	        static void Main()  
5.	      {  
6.	          Program p1 = new Program();  //a object of class  
7.	          p1.myVar = 10;  
8.	          Console.WriteLine(p1.myVar);  
9.	          Console.ReadKey();  
10.	      }  
11.	  }  

In the above example, myVar is a non-static field so to use this field we first need to create the object of that class. On the other hand, static data is shared among all the objects of that class. That is, for all the objects of a class, there will be only one copy of static data. Let's have an example.
1.	class Program  
2.	 {  
3.	     public static int myVar;  //a static field  
4.	       static void Main()  
5.	     {  
6.	         //Program p1 = new Program();  //a object of class  
7.	         myVar = 10;  
8.	         Console.WriteLine(myVar);  
9.	         Console.ReadKey();  
10.	     }  
11.	 }  
In the above we don't have an object of the class to use that field since the field is static.
If you create your own class and you think only one copy of the data (method) is needed among all instances of the class, you can create your own static method.  Learn more here: Static Class  and Static Class Members In C#
Notable Points here are:
1.	A static method can be invoked directly from the class level
2.	A static method does not require any class object
3.	Any main() method is shared through the entire class scope so it always appears with static keyword.
C# language also has several other types of methods. Read more Types of Methods in C#.

Static Class (GITHUB)
Static class nedir
A static class is a class which can not be instantiated. We do not need to create an object of a static class like we did in non-static classes. Members of static classes can be accessed directly using the class name followed by a (.) and class member name. Class Members can be methods, fields, properties, or events. A static class can contain only the static members while a non-static class can contain static members. Also, Static classes are by-default sealed so they cannot be inherited.

To declare a class and its members as static, 'static' keyword are used as shown below,
1.	using System;  
2.	  
3.	namespace Tutpoint  
4.	{  
5.	    // Static class  
6.	    static class TutLovers  
7.	    {  
8.	        // Static Variable  
9.	        public static int val_Static;  
10.	  
11.	        // Static Method  
12.	        public static void Addition_Static()  
13.	        {  
14.	            Console.Write("Static Method");  
15.	        }  
16.	  
17.	        // Static property  
18.	        public static int Addition_NonStatic  
19.	        {  
20.	            get; set;  
21.	        }  
22.	    }  
For more understanding see the example shown below,

The example shown below contains two non-static classes named "TutLovers" and "TutHaters". Here a class "TutLovers" contains static as well as non-static methods and variable. When we access them from class "TutHaters" then, For the static members, they will be accessed directly using class name followed by (.) and
For non-static members, we have created an object of that class.


1.	using System;  
2.	  
3.	namespace Tutpoint  
4.	{  
5.	    class TutLovers  
6.	    {  
7.	        public static int val_Static;  
8.	  
9.	        public int val_NonStatic;  
10.	  
11.	        public static void Addition_Static()  
12.	        {  
13.	            Console.Write("Static Method");  
14.	        }  
15.	  
16.	        public void Addition_NonStatic()  
17.	        {  
18.	            Console.Write("Non-Static Method");  
19.	        }  
20.	    }  
21.	  
22.	    //If the class is non-static  
23.	    class TutHaters  
24.	    {  
25.	        public void Haters()  
26.	        {  
27.	            //Object of TutLovers class is created  
28.	            TutLovers tutLovers = new TutLovers();  
29.	  
30.	            //Non-Static members can be called only from object  
31.	            tutLovers.Addition_NonStatic();  
32.	            tutLovers.val_NonStatic = 5;  
33.	  
34.	            //Static members can only be called using class_name followed by a (.)  
35.	            TutLovers.Addition_Static();  
36.	            TutLovers.val_Static = 5;  
37.	  
38.	            /* When we try to access static member from object then it will create an error  
39.	            Error as "Members 'TutLovers.Addition_Static()' can not be accessed with an instance referen            -ce; qualify it with a type name instead" */
40.	            tutLovers.Addition_Static();  
41.	  
42.	            /* When we try to access non-static member using class_name then it will create an error  
43.	            Error as "An object reference is required for the non-static field                                      , method or property 'TutLovers.Addition_NonStatic()'" */
44.	            TutLovers.Addition_NonStatic();  
45.	        }  
46.	    }  
47.	  
48.	}  
As shown above, when we try to access static member with an instance reference, it will create an error as "Members 'TutLovers.Addition_Static()' can not be accessed with an instance reference; qualify it with a type name instead" and when we try to access non-static member using class_name then it will create an error as "An object reference is required for the non-static field, method or property 'TutLovers.Addition_NonStatic()'".

Virtual Method 	(GITHUB) (notread)
Virtual Method nedir

Virtual (sanal metod) ‘lar kalıtıldığı sınıflarda içeriği değiştirilebilen metodlardır. Yani temel sınfımız da bir method oluşturuyoruz. Bu methodun içeriğini ileride değiştirme ihtiyacı duyuyoruz bu gibi durumlarda methodumuza virtual anahtar kelimesini ekleyerek override (ezmek) etmeye olanak tanımış oluyoruz. Bir örnek ile anlatırsak daha iyi olabilir.
Virtual metodları aslında bir çok yerde kullanabiliriz, ama genel olarak kullanım şekilleri aşağıdaki gibidir.
•	Sadece metod isimlerini belirteceğimiz bir classımız olsun, metodların ne işlev yapacağını diğer classlarda belirtecek isek Virtual metod kullanırız.
•	Birden çok Class larımızın, aynı anlama gelen metodları varsa, bu metodu Virtual olarak tanımlarız.
•	Yazılımda standartlaşmak önemlidir, eğer geliştirilen uygulamamızın farklı modüllerinde, metod isimlerimizin aynı olması isteniyorsa, yine Virtual metod kullanırız.

Örneğimizi İnceleyelim;
public class Cizim
{
   public int sayi { get; set; }
    public virtual void Draw()
    {
        //Draw methodunu virtual olarak yazıyorum ki daha sonra içeriği değiştirilebilsin.
        Console.WriteLine("Ben cizim nesnesiyim");
     }
}
public class cizgi : Cizim
{
    public override void Draw()
    {
        //Override etmeden önceki kodu çalıştırç
        base.Draw();
        Console.WriteLine("Ben cizim nesnesiyim-----------------");
     }
}
Çıktısı;
 
Örneğimizde Çizim nesnesindeki Draw methodunu override ederek içeriğini değiştiriyoruz.
DETAY:
A virtual method is a method that can be redefined in derived classes. A virtual method has an implementation in a base class as well as derived the class. It is used when a method's basic functionality is the same but sometimes more functionality is needed in the derived class. A virtual method is created in the base class that can be overriden in the derived class. We create a virtual method in the base class using the virtual keyword and that method is overriden in the derived class using the override keyword.
 
When a method is declared as a virtual method in a base class then that method can be defined in a base class and it is optional for the derived class to override that method. The overriding method also provides more than one form for a method. Hence it is also an example for polymorphism.
 
When a method is declared as a virtual method in a base class and that method has the same definition in a derived class then there is no need to override it in the derived class. But when a virtual method has a different definition in the base class and the derived class then there is a need to override it in the derived class.
 
When a virtual method is invoked, the run-time type of the object is checked for an overriding member. The overriding member in the most derived class is called, which might be the original member, if no derived class has overridden the member.
Virtual Method in C#
1.	By default, methods are non-virtual. We can't override a non-virtual method.
2.	We can't use the virtual modifier with the static, abstract, private or override modifiers. 
Difference between virtual and non-virtual methods
 
We have two classes; one is a "Vehicle" class and another is a "Cart" class. The "Vehicle" class is the base class that has two methods; one is a virtual method "Speed()" and another is a non-virtual method "Average()". So the base class virtual method "Speed()" is overriden in the sub class. We have one more class "Program" (the execution class) that has an entry point where we create an instance of sub class "Cart" and that instance is assigned to the base class "Vehicle" type. When we call virtual and non-virtual methods by both class's instance then according to the run type the instance virtual method implementation is invoked; in other words both class's instances invoke the subclass override method and the non-virtual method invoked is determined based on the instance of the class.

Invoked Virtual Method that override and not override in derived classes
 
We have three classes "Shape","Rectangle" and "Circle". Class "Shape" is a base class. Both "Rectangle" and "Circle" are derived classes from the base class. Base class "Shape" has virtual method "Area()". Virtual method "Area()" is overriden in the derived class "Rectangle" but not overriden in the derived class "Circle". When the virtual methods are overriden in a derived class and that derived class uses an instance then invokes a derived class overriden method. When a virtual method is not overriden in a derived class and uses that derived class instance then invokes base class virtual method.

Command Line Interface / CLI (GITHUB)
Command Line Interface nedir, cli nedir, CLI nedir

Örneğin windows'taki CLI, şu siyah ekrana sahip olan, içinde sadece kodlar bulunan, içine sadece kodlar yazılan o ekrandır. 

CLI stands for:

Command Line Interface
Command Line Interpreter
Command Line Input
Command Line Input
CLI is a command line program that accepts text input to execute operating system functions.

In the 1960s, using only computer terminals, this was the only way to interact with computers.

In the 1970s an 1980s, command line input was commonly used by Unix systems and PC systems like MS-DOS and Apple DOS.

Today, with graphical user interfaces (GUI), most users never use command-line interfaces (CLI).

However, CLI is still used by software developers and system administrators to configure computers, install software, and access features that are not available in the graphical interface.

Examples
The software package manager npm uses command line input to install software:

Windows Example
C:\>npm install mysoftware
Mac OS Example
>npm install mysoftware
You can navigate your folders (directories) with command line commands:

Windows Example
C:\Users\myuser>cd ..
C:\Users\>cd ..
C:\>
Use CLI commands with great attention!!!

Wrong use can easily delete files or destroy your computer system completely.

Basic Linux CLI Commands
Command	Description
ls	List the directory (folder) system.
cd pathname	Change directory (folder) in the file system.
cd ..	Move one level up (one folder) in the file system.
cp	Copy a file to another folder.
mv	Move a file to another folder.
mkdir	Creates a new directory (folder).
rmdir	Remove a directory (folder).
clear	Clears the CLI window.
exit	Closes the CLI window.

Integration (GITHUB)  (read)
integration nedir
Integration is the act of bringing together smaller components into a single system that functions as one. In an IT context, integration refers to the end result of a process that aims to stitch together different, often disparate, subsystems so that the data contained in each becomes part of a larger, more comprehensive system that, ideally, quickly and easily shares data when needed. This often requires that companies build a customized architecture or structure of applications to combine new or existing hardware, software and other communications.

Integration is harder to achieve the greater the number of systems that are involved and companies often choose to have external contractors manage some or all phases of the development of the new system. Specific activities having to do with IT system integration include project planning, project management, design and implementation of application programming interfaces, Web services and any process that accounts for the free flow of data or information delivery.
Challenges to achieving integration mostly have to do with the inherent difficulties in linking a series of diverse existing systems that could be produced by multiple different manufacturers. Other integration challenges have to do with the lack of a coherent or unifying data structure linking all of the different systems, an unwieldy framework of multiple different applications and support systems, the sheer age of the different systems and the actual delivery of the information to key business units that need it. These integration challenges hinder overall process efficiency because poor data exchange between systems prevents quick communication among business units.

On-premises Software  	(GITHUB)
on premises software nedir, on-premises software nedir, on premise software nedir, on premise nedir
-Şirket içi yazılımlar, sunucu çiftliği veya bulut gibi uzak bir tesise değil, yazılımı kullanan kişi veya kuruluşun tesislerine yüklenir ve bilgisayarlarda çalışır.
Bildiğin "yerel" yani.
On-premises software (commonly misstated as on-premise, and alternatively abbreviated "on-prem")[1] is installed and runs on computers on the premises of the person or organization using the software, rather than at a remote facility such as a server farm or cloud. On-premises software is sometimes referred to as “shrinkwrap” software, and off-premises software is commonly called “software as a service” ("SaaS") or “cloud computing”.
Grammar
There is some debate as to the grammatical correctness of the term on-premise as a synonym for on-premises.[2][3][4] In normal English usage, a premise is a proposition or presupposition in a logical argument, while premises (as well as being the plural of premise) means a property and its grounds, and is used only in the plural form.[5] People have mistakenly used what they believe to be the singular form premise, yet such use is incorrect in common or legal contexts.[6] When referring to technology, many companies and news sources commonly misuse the term on-premise such that it has become a common variant of on-premises.[7] [8]

CLR	(GITHUB) (not yet)
CLR nedir
Common Language Runtime.
The exact meaning depends on the context, but Common Language Runtime usually refers to the runtime of .NET Framework. The CLR handles memory allocation and management. The CLR is also a virtual machine that not only executes apps but also generates and compiles code on-the-fly using a JIT compiler. The current Microsoft CLR implementation is Windows only.
.Net Framework ün en alt katmanında CLR (Common Languange Runtime – Ortak Dil Platformu) mevcuttur. 
.Net platformunda yazılmış olan kodların (c#, J# veya VB) ortak bir alanda işletim sisteminizin algılayacağı dile çevrilmesini sağlamaktadır. Bu işlem sırasında kodlar ilk olarak MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Languange – Ara Dil) e çevrilir. Bu dönüştürmenin sebebi işletim sisteminin algılayacağı dile dönüştürmeden önce farklı dillerde yazılan kodları ortak noktada buluşturmaktır. Böylelikle MSIL kodu CLR katmanı ile farklı işletim sistemlerinde çalıştırılabilir hale gelir ve gelecekte yeni bir dille yazılan kodlar da MSIL a dönüştürerek işletim sisteminde çalışmasını sağlayacaktır.

ByteCode	(GITHUB) (not yet)
ByteCode nedir
Bytecode is program code that has been compiled from source code into low-level code designed for a software interpreter. It may be executed by a virtual machine (such as a JVM) or further compiled into machine code, which is recognized by the processor.
Different types of bytecode use different syntax, which can be read and executed by the corresponding virtual machine. A popular example is Java bytecode, which is compiled from Java source code and can be run on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Below are examples of Java bytecode instructions.
new (create new object)
aload_0 (load reference)
istore (store integer value)
ladd (add long value)
swap (swap two values)
areturn (return value from a function)
While it is possible to write bytecode directly, it is much more difficult than writing code in a high-level language, like Java. Therefore, bytecode files, such as Java .CLASS files, are most often generated from source code using a compiler, like javac.

Bytecode vs Assembly Language
Bytecode is similar to assembly language in that it is not a high-level language, but it is still somewhat readable, unlike machine language. Both may be considered "intermediate languages" that fall between source code and machine code. The primary difference between the two is that bytecode is generated for a virtual machine (software), while assembly language is created for a CPU (hardware).
The key of java power "Write once, run everywhere" is bytecode. The way bytecodes get converted to the appropriate native instructions for an application has a huge impact on the speed of an application. These bytecode can be interpreted, compiled to native code or directly executed on a processor whose Instruction Set Architecture is the bytecode specification. Interpreting the bytecode which is the standard implementation of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) makes execution of programs slow. To improve performance, JIT compilers interact with the JVM at run time and compile appropriate bytecode sequences into native machine code. When using a JIT compiler, the hardware can execute the native code, as opposed to having the JVM interpret the same sequence of bytecode repeatedly and incurring the penalty of a relatively lengthy translation process. This can lead to performance gains in the execution speed, unless methods are executed less frequently. The time that a JIT compiler takes to compile the bytecode is added to the overall execution time, and could lead to a higher execution time than an interpreter for executing the bytecode if the methods that are compiled by the JIT are not invoked frequently. The JIT compiler performs certain optimizations when compiling the bytecode to native code. Since the JIT compiler translates a series of bytecode into native instructions, it can perform some simple optimizations. Some of the common optimizations performed by JIT compilers are data-analysis, translation from stack operations to register operations, reduction of memory accesses by register allocation, elimination of common sub-expressions etc. The higher the degree of optimization done by a JIT compiler, the more time it spends in the execution stage. Therefore a JIT compiler cannot afford to do all the optimizations that is done by a static compiler, both because of the overhead added to the execution time and because it has only a restricted view of the program.

Memory Allocation	(GITHUB) (not yet)
Memory Allocation nedir
What does Memory Allocation mean?
Memory allocation is a process by which computer programs and services are assigned with physical or virtual memory space.

Memory allocation is the process of reserving a partial or complete portion of computer memory for the execution of programs and processes. Memory allocation is achieved through a process known as memory management.
Memory allocation is primarily a computer hardware operation but is managed through operating system and software applications. Memory allocation process is quite similar in physical and virtual memory management. Programs and services are assigned with a specific memory as per their requirements when they are executed. Once the program has finished its operation or is idle, the memory is released and allocated to another program or merged within the primary memory.
Memory allocation has two core types;
Static Memory Allocation: The program is allocated memory at compile time.
Dynamic Memory Allocation: The programs are allocated with memory at run time.

Executable Code (GITHUB)
Executable Code nedir
Software in a form that can be run in the computer. Executable code generally refers to machine language, which is the set of native instructions the computer carries out in hardware. Executable files in the DOS/Windows world use .EXE and .COM file extensions, while executable files in Mac, Linux and Unix do not require specific extensions. They are identified by their file structure.

Executable code may also refer to programs written in interpreted languages that require additional software to actually execute. Some interpreted languages remain in their source code form, such as JavaScript and VBScript, while others are compiled into an intermediate language, such as Java and Visual Basic. Interpreted languages require software "runtime engines" to convert the program into executable instructions for a particular CPU family that the hardware executes. See machine language, runtime engine, linker, compiler, intermediate language, x86 and Java Virtual Machine.

J# (GITHUB)
J# nedir 
Visual J# (pronounced "jay-sharp") is an implementation of the J# programming language that was a transitional language for programmers of Java and Visual J++ languages, so they could use their existing knowledge and applications with the .NET Framework.[1][2] It was introduced in 2002 and discontinued in 2007, with support for the final release of the product continuing until October 2017.
Fundamental differences between J# and Java
Java and J# use the same general syntax but there are non-Java conventions in J# to support the .NET environment. For example, to use .NET "properties" with a standard JavaBean class, it is necessary to prefix getter and setter methods with the Javadoc-like annotation:            /** @beanproperty   */ 
J# does not compile Java-language source code to Java bytecode.
JavaWorld said: "J#'s interface to the .NET framework is solid, but not as seamless as C#. In particular, J# code cannot define new .NET attributes, events, value types, or delegates. J# can make use of these language constructs if they are defined in an assembly written in another language, but its inability to define new ones limits J#'s reach and interoperability compared to other .NET languages."[5]

Statik Tipli Diller İle Dinamik Tipli Diller Arasındaki Farklar 	(edited,ekle) (Read)
Statik tipli dil nedir, statik tipli diller nedir, statik dil nedir
Programlama dillerinde yapılan her işlem öncesi hataları önlemek için verilerin tip kontrolü yapılır. Bu tür kontrollere ”Checking”  adı verilir. Checking işlemleri compile-time (derleme esnasında) veya run-time (çalışma esnasında) olarak yapılır. 

İşte bu farklılık Statik Tipli ve Dinamik Tipli dillerin temel ayrım noktalarından biridir.

Statik Tipli dillerde her değişkenin değişmez bir tipi olmak zorundadır. Uygulama geliştirenler ya bu tipi bizzat belirler yada Derleyici tarafından belirlenir. 

Statik Tipli dillerde yapılan işlemlerden önce Tip Konrolü yapıldığı için, operandların tiplerinin belirlenmesi gerekir. Tip kontrolleri compile (derleme) esnasında yapılır. 
Bu tarz dillere örnek olarak Java, C, C++ ,C# ,F# ,Aida ,Fortran ,Haskell ,ML ,Objective-C ,Pascal dilleri verilebilir.

Değişkenlerin ve ifadelerin tipleri run-time (çalışma) esnasında belirlenir. 

Bu tarz dillere örnek olarak Groovy, Javascript, Lisp, Lua, PHP, Prolog, Python, Ruby, Smalltalk dilleri verilebilir.

Statik Tipli Diller ile Dinamik Tipli dillerin birbirlerine üstünlükleri konusunda birçok fikir ortaya atılıyor. İkisinin de birbirlerine üstün oldukları noktalar var.

Statik Tipli dillerde derleme (compile-time) esnasında tip kontrolü yapıldığı için programın çalışması esnasında ekstra tip kontrolü yapılmaz, bu da uygulamanın çok daha verimli ve hızlı çalışması anlamına gelir. 

Dinamik Tipli dillerde ise çalışma (run-time) esnasında kontrol yapılması ufak da olsa bir yavaşlamaya sebep olmaktadır. Ayrıca yine bu özellikten dolayı her değişkenin tip bilgisi hafızada saklanmak zorundadır. Bu durum ekstra bir hafıza yükü anlamına gelir. Statik Tipli dillerde derleme (compile-time) esnasında tip kontrolü yapıldığı için ekstra bir hafızaya gerek duyulmaz.

Statik Tipli dillerde derleme (compile-time) esnasında herhangi bir hata yakalanmadı ise tip hatası oluşmamış demektir yani Dinamik Tipli dillere nazaran çok daha güvenlidir. Dinamik Tipli dillerde ise böyle bir kesinlik bulunmaz. 

Öte yandan Dinamik Tipli diller Developer’lara çok büyük esneklik sağlar. Gelen verinin türünün bilinmediği uygulamalarda çok kullanışlıdır. Ayrıca uygulama geliştirenler bir değişkene farklı noktalarda farklı değerler atayabilirler.

Dynamic typing vs. static typing
This topic is provided for reverence only as it explains the differences between dynamic and static typing. Understanding the differences between dynamic and static typing is key to understanding the way in which transformation script errors are handled, and how it is different from the way Groovy handles errors. This will also help you interpret errors created by your transformation script.
Note: It is important to know that the Groovy implementation within Big Data Discovery enforces static typing. For information on exception handling in Transform, which uses a static parser overriding Groovy's dynamic typing behavior, see Exception handling and troubleshooting your scripts.
There are two main differences between dynamic typing and static typing that you should be aware of when writing transformation scripts.
First, dynamically-typed languages perform type checking at runtime, while statically typed languages perform type checking at compile time. This means that scripts written in dynamically-typed languages (like Groovy) can compile even if they contain errors that will prevent the script from running properly (if at all). If a script written in a statically-typed language (such as Java) contains errors, it will fail to compile until the errors have been fixed.
Second, statically-typed languages require you to declare the data types of your variables before you use them, while dynamically-typed languages do not. Consider the two following code examples:
// Java example
int num;
num = 5;
// Groovy example
num = 5
Both examples do the same thing: create a variable called num and assign it the value 5. The difference lies in the first line of the Java example, int num;, which defines num's data type as int. Java is statically-typed, so it expects its variables to be declared before they can be assigned values. 
Groovy is dynamically-typed and determines its variables' data types based on their values, so this line is not required.
Dynamically-typed languages are more flexible and can save you time and space when writing scripts. However, this can lead to issues at runtime. For example:
// Groovy example
number = 5
numbr = (number + 15) / 2  // note the typo
The code above should create the variable number with a value of 5, then change its value to 10 by adding 15 to it and dividing it by 2. However, number is misspelled at the beginning of the second line. Because Groovy does not require you to declare your variables, it creates a new variable called numbr and assigns it the value number should have. This code will compile just fine, but may produce an error later on when the script tries to do something with number assuming its value is 10.
Güzel anlatım:
What is static typing? And what’s dynamic typing? I’ll answer both questions in this introductory article, and we’ll discuss the debate surrounding the very definition of these concepts.
You do not have to know any particular programming language to understand the concepts; however, I shall make references to the programming language Perl, PHP and Python, (in the form of codes) in the article. Those who don’t know Python should think of the code as pseudocode, and things will just be fine. Static typing and dynamic typing are the concerns of programming language design; thus a lack of knowledge of any particular type is not going to harm your understanding of these concepts. In all the code fragments within this article, I have explicitly mentioned the programming language in which the code is written, using "/*……*/" (quotes not included).
To begin with, I should mention that "typing" in terms of static and dynamic typing refers to "type" as in data type — not the process of pressing keys on a keyboard. Though this might have sounded quite obvious, it may not be to some. "Static" and "dynamic" are the types of "typing" that we shall see in the sections that follow. Languages that have static typing or dynamic typing are said to be "static typed" or "dynamic typed".
Static Typing
Static typed programming languages are those in which variables need not be defined before they’re used. This implies that static typing has to do with the explicit declaration (or initialization) of variables before they’re employed. Java is an example of a static typed language; C and C++ are also static typed languages. Note that in C (and C++ also), variables can be cast into other types, but they don’t get converted; you just read them assuming they are another type.
Static typing does not imply that you have to declare all the variables first, before you use them; variables maybe be initialized anywhere, but developers have to do so before they use those variables anywhere. Consider the following example:
/* C code */ 
static int num, sum; // explicit declaration 
num = 5; // now use the variables 
sum = 10; 
sum = sum + num;
The above code fragment is an example of how variable declaration in static typed languages generally appears. Note that in the above code, static has nothing to do with static typing; it has been used along with int only to initialize num and sum to zero.
Dynamic Typing
Dynamic typed programming languages are those languages in which variables must necessarily be defined before they are used. This implies that dynamic typed languages do not require the explicit declaration of the variables before they’re used. Python is an example of a dynamic typed programming language, and so is PHP. Consider the following example:
/* Python code */ 
num = 10 // directly using the variable
In the above code fragment, we have directly assigned the variable num the value 10 before initializing it. This is characteristic to dynamic typed programming languages.
Another Analogy
A lot of people define static typing and dynamic typing with respect to the point at which the variable types are checked. Using this analogy, static typed languages are those in which type checking is done at compile-time, whereas dynamic typed languages are those in which type checking is done at run-time.
This analogy leads to the analogy we used above to define static and dynamic typing. I believe it is simpler to understand static and dynamic typing in terms of the need for the explicit declaration of variables, rather than as compile-time and run-time type checking.
Static Typing and Dynamic Typing versus Strong Typing and Weak Typing
Static and dynamic typing, and strong and weak typing, are two totally different concepts, which, unfortunately, are very often confused. It is erroneous to say that a language that is static or dynamic typed cannot be strong or weak typed. Static and dynamic typing, and strong and weak typing, are different forms of classification of programming languages, and one of each class necessarily characterizes a given language. It is thus imperative to discuss strong and weak typing vis-a-vis static and dynamic typing.
Programming languages that exhibit "strong typing" are "strong typed," and those that exhibit "weak typing" are "weak typed".
Strong Typing
Programming languages in which variables have specific data types are strong typed. This implies that in strong typed languages, variables are necessarily bound to a particular data type. Python is strong typed, and so is Java. The distinction between strong typing and weak typing is more subtle and thus more difficult to grasp than is the distinction between static typing and dynamic typing. Consider the following example:
/* Python code */ 
>>> foo = "x" 
>>> foo = foo + 2 
Traceback (most recent call last): 
  File "<pyshell#3>", line 1, in ? 
    foo = foo + 2 
TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects 
>>>
In the above Python example (run from the Python shell), foo is of str type. In the second line, we’re attempting to add 2 (an int) to a variable of str type. As we can see, a TypeError is returned, indicating that a str object cannot be concatenated with an int object. This is what characterizes strong typed languages: variables are bound to a particular data type.
Weak Typing
As opposed to strong typed languages, weak typed languages are those in which variables are not of a specific data type. It should be noted that this does not imply that variables do not have types; it does mean that variables are not "bound" to a specific data type. PHP and C are examples of weak typed languages. Consider the following:
/* PHP code */ 
<?php 
$foo = "x"; 
$foo = $foo + 2; // not an error 
echo $foo; 
?>
In this example, foo is initially a string type. In the second line, we add this string variable to 2, an integer. This is permitted in PHP, and is characteristic of all weak typed languages.
Now that we know about the two concepts, we can augment both of them to characterize any given language. Thus, Python is dynamic typed and strong typed; Java is static typed and strong typed; PHP is dynamic typed and weak typed; C is static typed and weak typed (owing to its casting ability).
Dynamic Typing is Good
In a dynamic typed language, you don’t have to initialize variables, which is a big bonus for many developers. Programmers like the fact that you can use a variable at will when required (without having to initialize it). Dynamic typing is characteristic of many of the scripting languages: Perl, PHP, Python, etc. Dynamic typing, in fact, does save you from writing a few "extra" lines of code, which, in turn, means less time spent writing code.
Or Is It?  



 
The very characteristic of dynamic typed languages that appeals to many developers is also a pitfall, and a major one at that. Consider the following simple example:
/* Python code */ 
my_variable = 10 
while my_variable > 0: 
        i = foo(my_variable) 
        if i < 100: 
                my_variable++ 
        else 
                my_varaible = (my_variable + i) / 10 // spelling error intentional
As you can see in the above code, my_varaible is a spelling mistake that the programmer could have very well made. The problem here is that, since Python is dynamically typed, it will not return an error, but instead will create a new variable called my_varaible. So, now we have two variables: my_variable and my_varaible. This obviously is a serious problem; some would suggest that forced variable declaration is an important requirement in any programming language.
Static Typed Behavior in Dynamic Typed Languages
Perl is a dynamic typed programming language. However, it provides a means to "simulate" static typing by means of a pragma called strict. Consider the following Perl example:
/* Perl code */ 
$sum = 10; 
print $sum;
The above code will run without any problem, and will print 10 to the console. Note that here, we have not initialized the variable sum; this exemplifies the dynamic typing characteristic of Perl. To enforce variable declaration, we make use of the strict pragma as follows:
/* Perl code */ 
use strict; 
$sum = 10; 
print $sum;
The above code fragment will return the following error when you try to run it:
Global symbol "$num" requires explicit package name at perl.pl line 2. 
Execution of perl.pl aborted due to compilation errors.
To rectify the above error, we are forced to declare the variable num as follows:
/* Perl code */ 
use strict; 
my $num; // forced declaration 
$sum = 10; 
print $sum;
The above codes are specific to Perl; not all programming languages have a way to enforce variable declaration: Python, for example doesn’t have a way to enforce variable declaration. However, there is a tool, called "pychecker" (available here), that can be used to "detect" stray variables; this is, of course, far from a desirable solution.
Static Typed or Dynamic Typed?
There are advocates of both forms of typing. Asserting that one is better than the other would only lead to a debate of no consequence.
There are those who advocate dynamic typing for the simplicity and saving in terms of time that it offers; they believe that type checking need not be an integral part of the programming language design per se, but instead, that third-party solutions (like pychecker) could be used to server that purpose.
On the other hand, there are advocates of static typing, who believe that static typing (leading to forced variable declaration) is an important requirement of programming language design.
Conclusion
Static typing and dynamic typing, and strong and weak typing, are topics of programming language design that are not always clearly defined and, as a result, are not very well understood. This article has given you an insight into the concepts of static and dynamic typing as well as strong and weak typing.

Entity Framework için constructor (GITHUB)
Entity Framework için constructor

class User(

)

içine parametre alan bir constructor oluşturmuşsan eğer:

parametresiz bir constructor da oluşturmalısın. Boş kalsın. Neden bunu yapmamız gerekiyor?

Entity framework, User class'ının instance'ını bu parametreli constructor'u kullanarak oluşturamaz da ondan. Bir düşün. Entity framework nasıl instance oluştursun (veya obje initialize etsin) eğer boş bir constructor yoksa?

O yüzden,

Boş ctor oluşturmamız gerekiyor. Bu boş ctor wrong state'e girmemize yol açabilir. Yani boş olan ctor bazı sıkıntılara yol açabilir. O yüzden boş ctor'u protected yapabiliriz. Çok iyi olur.

Navigation Property (GITHUB)
Navigation property nedir
A navigation property is an optional property on an entity type that allows for navigation from one end of an association to the other end. Unlike other properties, navigation properties do not carry data.
A navigation property definition includes the following:
•	A name. (Required)
•	The association that it navigates. (Required)
•	The ends of the association that it navigates. (Required)
Önemli:
Navigation properties are optional on both entity types at the ends of an association. If you define a navigation property on one entity type at the end of an association, you do not have to define a navigation property on the entity type at the other end of the association.
The data type of a navigation property is determined by the multiplicity of its remote association end. For example, suppose a navigation property, OrdersNavProp, exists on a Customer entity type and navigates a one-to-many association between Customer and Order. Because the remote association end for the navigation property has multiplicity of many (*), its data type is a collection (of Order). Similarly, if a navigation property, CustomerNavProp, exists on the Order entity type, its data type would be Customer, because the multiplicity of the remote end is one (1).

ERRORS  (GITHUB)
404: Links that don’t lead anywhere are known as 'dead links' or 'broken links'. The HTTP status code 404 is often referred to as 'error 404', 'HTTP 404', or '404 code'.
The typical trigger for an error 404 message is when website content has been removed or moved to another URL. There are also other reasons why an error message could appear. These include:

The URL or its content (such as files or images) was either deleted or moved (without adjusting any internal links accordingly)
The URL was writtenincorrectly (during the creation process or a redesign), linkedincorrectly, or typed into the browser incorrectly
The server responsible for the website is not running or the connection is broken
The requested domain name can’t be converted to an IP by the domain name system (DNS)
The entered domain name doesn’t exist (anymore)

HTTPGet vs HTTPPost	(GITHUB) 
Httpget nedir httppost nedir
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Un2JTC7tFPI
Videoyu izle…
Get yapınca veriler url ye yazılır. Post ta ise form yollanır… Url ile yollanmaz veri. Message body içinde yollanır.
Get metotlara url'ye yazıp enter yaparak ulaşılır. O yüzden tehlikeli olabilir…
DB'deki değerleri hem Get hem Post ile değiştirebiliriz tabi ki. Ama dediğimiz gibi get ile bunu yapmak tehlikelidir.

HTTPPost method hides information from URL and does not bind data to URL. It is more secure than HttpGet method but it is slower than HttpGet. It is only useful when you are passing sensitive information to the server.
The GET Method
GET is used to request data from a specified resource. 
GET is one of the most common HTTP methods. 
Note that the query string (name/value pairs) is sent in the URL of a GET request: 
/test/demo_form.php?name1=value1&name2=value2
Some other notes on GET requests: 
GET requests can be cached
GET requests remain in the browser history
GET requests can be bookmarked
GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data
GET requests have length restrictions
GET requests are only used to request data (not modify)

The POST Method
POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource. 
The data sent to the server with POST is stored in the request body of the HTTP request: 
POST /test/demo_form.php HTTP/1.1
Host: w3schools.com
name1=value1&name2=value2
(yukarıda request body'nin neye benzediğini görmüş olduk. Get request'lerde request body yoktur. Veri url'den gönderilir)
Some other notes on POST requests:
POST requests are never cached
POST requests do not remain in the browser history
POST requests cannot be bookmarked
POST requests have no restrictions on data length

GET methodu HTTP istekleri arasındaki varsayılan yöntemdir.  GET metodu ile yapılan istekler tarayıcının adres satırında görünür. Sadece belirli boyutta veri gönderileceği zaman kullanılır.
POST metodu ise URL’ de görünmesini istemediğimiz veriler olduğunda kullanılabilir. POST yönteminde gönderebileceğimiz verinin boyutu ile ilgili bir sınır yoktur. Ayrıca gönderdiğimiz parametrelerin adres satırında görünmemesi dolayısıyla GET yöntemine göre daha güvenlidir. HTML form gönderileceği zaman neredeyse her zaman POST yöntemi tercih edilir.
Örnek vermek gerekirse Kisilers tablomuzun olduğu bir proje üzerinde kişi bilgilerini düzenlemek isteyebiliriz. Bunun için genellikle iki Action oluştururuz. Bunlardan biri kişinin ID sini parametre olarak alan gelen ID ye göre kişinin bilgilerini Edit formunda açan Action iken diğeri POST olduğunda yani Kaydet butonuna tıklandığında kullanılacak Actiondur.

public ActionResult Edit(int? id)
{
if (id == null)
{  return new HttpStatusCodeResult(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest);  } 
Kisiler kisiler = db.Kisilers.Find(id);
if (kisiler == null) 
{
return HttpNotFound();
}
return View(kisiler);
} 
Yukarıda ki Action’ da querystring’imiz kisa iken aşağıdakinde Kisilers tablosundaki kolon sayısına göre uzunluğu değişecek bir querystring söz konusu. Ayrıca buradan dönen bilgilerinde adres çubuğunda görünmesini istemediğimiz için POST methodunu kullanırız.

Önemli:
Browsers can cache GET requests, generally on static data, like images or scripts. But you can also allow browsers to cache GET requests to controller actions as well, using [OutputCache] or other similar ways, so if caching is turned on for a GET controller action, it's possible that clicking on a link leading to /Home/Index doesn't actually run the Index method on the server, but rather allows the browser to serve up the page from its own cache.
With this line of thinking, you can safely turn on caching on GET actions in which the data you're serving up doesn't change (or doesn't change often), with the knowledge that your server action won't fire every time.
POSTs won't be cached by the browser, so any POST is guaranteed to make it to the server.

Güzel bir açıklama:
Ignore caching for a moment. Another way of thinking about this is that search engines will store HTTP GET links during their indexing/crawling process, therefore they will show up in search results.
Suppose if your /Home/Index is implemented as GET but it lets say deletes a row in your Database, every time this link shows up on a search engine and somebody clicks it, you will have a delete row, and soon you have a lot deleted rows.

Mutable / Immutable
Mutable nedir, immutable nedir:
Mutable and Immutable ?
In English Language Mutable means "can change" and immutable means "cannot change". The term Immutable Object means that the state of the Object cannot change after its creation. An immutable type sets the property or state of the object as read only because it cannot be modified after it is assigned during initialization.
Is String in .Net immutable ?
Yes, the String in .Net is immutable. The System.String class is an immutable type provided in the .NET framework class library. Since a String is an immutable type, it cannot be modified. When you modify a string you are actually creating a new string object with the desired value.
e.g.
 
The above code will create 1000 new string variables in the memory.
Immutability of strings has positive significance in multithreaded applications because it provides automatic thread safety. Instances of immutable types are inherently thread-safe, because no thread can modify it.
The main drawback of immutable types is that they require more resources than other object types. Because each time it modified, it creates a new one.
The above code segment creates 1000 new string variables. In these type of situations you should use the StringBuilder class, which allows you to modify the text without making new String class instances. StringBuilder is a Mutable type, that means when you alter it , it still holding same data.

Pointer
Pointer nedir?

C# supports pointers in a limited extent. A C# pointer is nothing but a variable that holds the memory address of another type. 

But in C# pointer can only be declared to hold the memory address of value types and arrays. Unlike reference types, pointer types are not tracked by the default garbage collection mechanism. For the same reason pointers are not allowed to point to a reference type or even to a structure type which contains a reference type. We can say that pointers can point to only unmanaged types which includes all basic data types, enum types, other pointer types and structs which contain only unmanaged types.

Stack: static memory allocation, çok hızlı. Allocation compile sırasında olur. Ne kadar memory e ihtiyacın olduğunu kestirebiliyosan Stack kullan.

Heap: Dynamic memory allocation, allocation run time'da olur. Bu memory'e erişim yavaştır. Dependency yoktur sağdaki soldaki elementlere. Yani kolayca silip memory yi boşaltabilirsin. Bu olaylar işi kompleksleştirir ve memorynin neresi boş neresi dolu bilmeyi zorlaştırır. Ne kadar memory e ihtiyacın olduğunu kestiremiyorsan bunu kullan. Üst üste yığma alegorisi. Yığ yığabildiğin kadar. Aynı alegoriden ötürü -> yavaş çalışır --> neyin nerede olduğu belirsiz çünkü üst üste yığıyorsun. Stack ise hızlı çünkü herşey düzgün şeklide üst üste koyuluyor.

Semantics 
semantics nedir, semantic nedir
In programming language theory, semantics is the field concerned with the rigorous mathematical study of the meaning of programming languages. It does so by evaluating the meaning of syntactically valid strings defined by a specific programming language, showing the computation involved. In such a case that the evaluation would be of syntactically invalid strings, the result would be non-computation. Semantics describes the processes a computer follows when executing a program in that specific language. This can be shown by describing the relationship between the input and output of a program, or an explanation of how the program will be executed on a certain platform, hence creating a model of computation.
Formal semantics, for instance, helps to write compilers, better understand what a program is doing, and to prove, e.g., that the following if statement
if 1 == 1 then S1 else S2
has the same effect as S1 alone.
Overview
The field of formal semantics encompasses all of the following:
•	The definition of semantic models
•	The relations between different semantic models
•	The relations between different approaches to meaning
•	The relation between computation and the underlying mathematical structures from fields such as logic, set theory, model theory, category theory, etc.
It has close links with other areas of computer science such as programming language design, type theory, compilers and interpreters, program verification and model checking.

Extension Methods in C#  (GITHUB-UPDATED) (read)
Extension method nedir 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/extension-methods
Extension methods enable you to "add" methods to existing types without creating a new derived type, recompiling, or otherwise modifying the original type. Extension methods are static methods, but they're called as if they were instance methods on the extended type. For client code written in C#, F# and Visual Basic, there's no apparent difference between calling an extension method and the methods defined in a type.
The most common extension methods are the LINQ standard query operators that add query functionality to the existing System.Collections.IEnumerable and System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<T> types. To use the standard query operators, first bring them into scope with a using System.Linq directive. Then any type that implements IEnumerable<T> appears to have instance methods such as GroupBy, OrderBy, Average, and so on. You can see these additional methods in IntelliSense statement completion when you type "dot" after an instance of an IEnumerable<T> type such as List<T> or Array.
OrderBy Example
The following example shows how to call the standard query operator OrderBy method on an array of integers. The expression in parentheses is a lambda expression. Many standard query operators take lambda expressions as parameters, but this isn't a requirement for extension methods. For more information, see Lambda Expressions.
class ExtensionMethods2
{

    static void Main()
    {
        int[] ints = { 10, 45, 15, 39, 21, 26 };
        var result = ints.OrderBy(g => g);
        foreach (var i in result)
        {
            System.Console.Write(i + " ");
        }
    }
}
//Output: 10 15 21 26 39 45
…
The following is the extension method we have created.
public static int myExtensionMethod(this string str) {
   return Int32.Parse(str);
}
Let us see an example wherein we have used extension method.
using System;
using System.Text;
namespace Program {
   public static class Demo {
      public static int myExtensionMethod(this string str) {
         return Int32.Parse(str);
      }
   }
   class Program {
      static void Main(string[] args) {
         string str1 = "565";
         int n = str1.myExtensionMethod();
         Console.WriteLine("Result: {0}", n);
         Console.ReadLine();
      }
   }
}
Output
Result: 565

Detaylı:
Extension methods are defined as static methods but are called by using instance method syntax. Their first parameter specifies which type the method operates on. The parameter is preceded by the this modifier. Extension methods are only in scope when you explicitly import the namespace into your source code with a using directive.
The following example shows an extension method defined for the System.String class. It's defined inside a non-nested, non-generic static class:
C#Copy
namespace ExtensionMethods
{
    public static class MyExtensions
    {
        public static int WordCount(this String str)
        {
            return str.Split(new char[] { ' ', '.', '?' },
                             StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries).Length;
        }
    }
}
The WordCount extension method can be brought into scope with this using directive:
C#Copy
using ExtensionMethods;
And it can be called from an application by using this syntax:
C#Copy
string s = "Hello Extension Methods";
int i = s.WordCount();
You invoke the extension method in your code with instance method syntax. The intermediate language (IL) generated by the compiler translates your code into a call on the static method. The principle of encapsulation is not really being violated. Extension methods cannot access private variables in the type they are extending.

Type Safety / Type Safe		(GITHUB)	 (read)
Type safety nedir, type safe nedir type-safe neir
Type safety means preventing type errors. Type error occurs when data type of one type is assigned to other type UNKNOWINGLY and we get undesirable results.
Type-safety should not be confused with static / dynamic typing or strong / weak typing.

Type safety in .NET has been introduced to prevent the objects of one type from peeking into the memory assigned for the other object. Writing safe code also means to prevent data loss during conversion of one type to another. 
 
What does it exactly means? Suppose I have two types defined as in the following:
1.	public class MyType  
2.	{  
3.	  public int Prop{ get; set;}  
4.	}  
5.	public class YourType  
6.	{  
7.	   public int Prop{get;set;}  
8.	   public int Prop1{get;set;}  
9.	}  
Now suppose, I create an object of MyType as in the following:
1.	MyType obj = new MyType();  
In memory obj would be referencing the 4 bytes of space and suppose next to that part of memory is another string. Now suppose I cast obj to YourType that thankfully is not at all possible in .NET but for a moment imagine that it would have been possible, in that case my code would look something as in the following,
1.	YourType obj1 = (YourType)obj; // Here we will get compile time error  
And suppose, I assign Prop using obj1 reference, as shown below:
1.	obj1.Prop = 10;  
Which is fine but suppose I want to assign value to Prop1 as shown below:
1.	obj1.Prop1 = 20;   
That can lead to some unpredictable results and bugs since this part of memory could be used by the string that I have talked about earlier. From this we can say that type safety comes to our rescue, when the compiler would not allow the casting that we have tried to do. This is a relief for the programmers with a background in unmanaged programming.
 
Now I want to discuss one more scenario in which type safety comes to our rescue. If we are using out or ref with our method parameter and when calling the method our argument does not match the method's parameter, the compiler would not allow the code to compile.
 
Let's take an example for it. I have user type defined as in the following:
1.	public class SomeType  
2.	{  
3.	}  
And I have function that takes a parameter of type object as shown below:
1.	private void ChangeValue(out object par)  
2.	{  
3.	   par = new String('x', 10);  
4.	}  
Now suppose I call the method ChangeValue as in the following that would not of course compile:
1.	SomeType obj = new SomeType();  
2.	ChangeValue(out obj); //compile time error  
If .NET would have allowed this code to execute, type safety could have easily been compromised here.
 
If the ChangeValue function has the parameter without the out keyword, there would not have been any compile time error, since the caller can have an argument type that derives from the parameter type.

If your data is of type X and X doesn't support operation y, then the language will not allow you to to execute y(X).
This definition doesn't set rules on when this is checked. It can be at compile time (static typing) or at runtime (dynamic typing), typically through exceptions. It can be a bit of both: some statically typed languages allow you to cast data from one type to another, and the validity of casts must be checked at runtime (imagine that you're trying to cast an Object to a Consumer - the compiler has no way of knowing whether it's acceptable or not).
Type-safety does not necessarily mean strongly typed, either - some languages are notoriously weakly typed, but still arguably type safe. Take Javascript, for example: its type system is as weak as they come, but still strictly defined. It allows automatic casting of data (say, strings to ints), but within well defined rules. There is to my knowledge no case where a Javascript program will behave in an undefined fashion, and if you're clever enough (I'm not), you should be able to predict what will happen when reading Javascript code.
An example of a type-unsafe programming language is C: reading / writing an array value outside of the array's bounds has an undefined behaviour by specification. It's impossible to predict what will happen. C is a language that has a type system, but is not type safe.

In computer science, type safety is the extent to which a programming language discourages or prevents type errors. A type error is erroneous or undesirable program behaviour caused by a discrepancy between differing data types for the program's constants, variables, and methods (functions), e.g., treating an integer (int) as a floating-point number (float). Type safety is sometimes alternatively considered to be a property of a computer program rather than the language in which that program is written; that is, some languages have type-safe facilities that can be circumvented by programmers who adopt practices that exhibit poor type safety. The formal type-theoretic definition of type safety is considerably stronger than what is understood by most programmers.

int a = 2;
int b = 3;
int c = a * b;
yukarıdaki int c = a * b;  
işlemindeki a ve b değişkenlerine operand denir. 
a değişkeni: sol operand
b değişkeni: sağ operand
Kaynak: aşağıdaki text
+	Adds two operands
-	Subtracts the second operand from the first
*	Multiplies both operands
/	Divides the numerator by de-numerator
%	Modulus Operator and a remainder of after an integer division
++	Increment operator increases integer value by one
--	Decrement operator decreases integer value by one

Relational Operators
These are operators used for performing Relational operations on numbers. Below is the list of relational operators available in C#.
Operator	Description
==	Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true.
!=	Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true.
>	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.
<	Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.
>=	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.
<=	Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.

operator
operator nedir, operatör nedir operators nedir, operatörler nedir
+  -  *  / << == >> gibi işaretler operatördür.
Operator in C# is a special symbol that specifies which operations to perform on operands. For example, in mathematics the plus symbol (+) signifies the sum of the left and right numbers. In the same way, C# has many operators that have different meanings based on the data types of the operands. C# operators usually have one or two operands. Operators that have one operand are called Unary operators.
The following table list some of the operators available in C#.
Operator category	Operators
Primary	x.y
Unary	+x
Multiplicative	x * y
Additive	x + y
Shift	x << y
Relational and type testing	x < y
Equality	x == y
Logical AND	x & y
Logical XOR	x ^ y
Logical OR	x | y
Conditional AND	x && y
Conditional OR	x || y
Null-coalescing	x ?? y
Conditional	?:
Assignment and lambda expression	x = y
As mentioned before, certain operators have different meanings based on the datatype of the operand. For example, if the + operator is used with numbers, it will add the numbers but if it is used with strings, it will concatenate the two strings.
When an operator does different things based on the datatype of the operands, it is called operator over loading.
The following C# code shows the use of the + sign operator on different datatypes:

Example: + Operator
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    string message1 = "Hello";

    string message2 = message1 + " World!!";    

    Console.WriteLine(message2);

    int i = 10, j = 20;

    int sum = i + j;

    Console.WriteLine("{0} + {1} = {2}", i, j, sum);

F# / F Sharp 
Fsharp nedir f sharp nedir f# nedir
F# originates from Microsoft Research, Cambridge, UK. The language was originally designed and implemented by Don Syme,[6] according to whom in the fsharp team, they say the F is for "Fun".[24] Andrew Kennedy contributed to the design of units of measure.[6] The Visual F# Tools for Visual Studio are developed by Microsoft.[6] The F# Software Foundation developed the F# open-source compiler and tools, incorporating the open-source compiler implementation provided by the Microsoft Visual F# Tools team.[11]

F# (pronounced F sharp) is a general purpose, strongly typed, multi-paradigm programming language that encompasses functional, imperative, and object-oriented programming methods. F# is most often used as a cross-platform Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) language, but it can also generate JavaScript[9] and graphics processing unit (GPU) code.[10]

Syntax:
F# da göze çarpan ilk önemli komut "let" dir. Bu komut ile bir değişkene değeri kaydederiz. Örnek: 
let ahmet = 10 <- 19

Operator Overloading
[operator overloading nedir] 

Most operators in C# can be overloaded, meaning they can be redefined for custom actions.
For example, you can redefine the action of the plus (+) operator in a custom class.

class Box
{
    public int Height { get; set; }
    public int Width { get; set; }
    public Box(int h, int w)
    {
        Height = h;
        Width = w;
    }
    public static Box operator +(Box a, Box b) // eksi işareti de kullanılabilirdi. Sonuç değişmez. Operatörle ilgisi yok yani. + - * / hepsi aynı sonuç.
    {
        int h = a.Height + b.Height;
        int w = a.Width + b.Width;
        Box res = new Box(h, w);
        return res;
    }
}
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Box b1 = new Box(14, 3);
    Box b2 = new Box(5, 7);
    Box b3 = b1 + b2;
 
    Console.WriteLine(b3.Height); //19
    Console.WriteLine(b3.Width); //10
    Console.ReadKey();
}

The method  public static Box operator +(Box a, Box b) defines an overloaded operator + with two Box object parameters and returning a new Box object whose Height and Width properties equal the sum of its parameter's corresponding properties.
Additionally, the overloaded operator must be static.

String  	(GITHUB)
String nedir
Note that you do not use the new operator to create a string object except when initializing the string with an array of chars.
Msdn goes here:
A string is an object of type String whose value is text. Internally, the text is stored as a sequential read-only collection of Char objects. There is no null-terminating character at the end of a C# string; therefore a C# string can contain any number of embedded null characters ('\0'). The Length property of a string represents the number of Char objects it contains, not the number of Unicode characters. To access the individual Unicode code points in a string, use the StringInfo object.
string vs. System.String
In C#, the string keyword is an alias for String. Therefore, String and string are equivalent, and you can use whichever naming convention you prefer. 
Declaring and Initializing Strings
You can declare and initialize strings in various ways, as shown in the following example:
(declare nedir örnek, initialization nedir örnek)
// Declare without initializing.
string message1;

// Initialize to null.
string message2 = null;

// Initialize as an empty string.
// Use the Empty constant instead of the literal "".
string message3 = System.String.Empty;

// Initialize with a regular string literal.
string oldPath = "c:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio 8.0";

// Initialize with a verbatim string literal.
string newPath = @"c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0";

// Use System.String if you prefer.
System.String greeting = "Hello World!";

// In local variables (i.e. within a method body)
// you can use implicit typing.
var temp = "I'm still a strongly-typed System.String!";

// Use a const string to prevent 'message4' from
// being used to store another string value.
const string message4 = "You can't get rid of me!";

// Use the String constructor only when creating
// a string from a char*, char[], or sbyte*. See
// System.String documentation for details.
char[] letters = { 'A', 'B', 'C' };
string alphabet = new string(letters);

Note that you do not use the new operator to create a string object except when initializing the string with an array of chars.
Initialize a string with the Empty constant value to create a new String object whose string is of zero length. The string literal representation of a zero-length string is "". By initializing strings with the Empty value instead of null, you can reduce the chances of a NullReferenceException occurring. Use the static IsNullOrEmpty(String) method to verify the value of a string before you try to access it.

Web Server	 (GITHUB)
Web server nedir

Web server ya da ağ sunucusu, internet üzerinde bir web sitesinin yayınından sorumlu olan sunucudur. Web server, Hosting ya da “barındırma” işlemini internet protokolü üzerinden sunan bir sunucudur. 
A Web server is software or hardware that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and other protocols to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web (WWW). Web server software controls how a user accesses hosted files. It is accessed through the domain names of websites and ensures the delivery of the site's content to the requesting user. As hardware, a Web server is a computer that holds web server software and other files related to a website, such as HTML documents, images and JavaScript files. Web server hardware is connected to the internet and allows data to be exchanged with other connected devices.
The Web server process is an example of the client/server model. All computers that host Web sites must have Web server software. Leading Web servers include Apache, Microsoft's Internet Information Server (IIS) and Nginx -- pronounced engine X. Other Web servers include Novell's NetWare server, Google Web Server (GWS) and IBM's family of Domino servers.
Web servers often come as part of a larger package of internet- and intranet-related programs that are used for:
•	Sending and receiving emails.
•	Downloading requests for File Transfer Protocol (FTP) files.
•	Building and publishing Web pages.
Considerations in choosing a Web server include how well it works with the operating system and other servers; its ability to handle server-side programming; security characteristics; and the particular publishing, search engine and site building tools that come with it.
So basically a web server is the software that receives your request to access a web page. It runs a few security checks on your HTTP request and takes you to the web page. Depending on the page you have requested, the page may ask the server to run a few extra modules while generating the document to serve you. It then serves you the document you requested. Pretty awesome isn’t it.

Web server ya da ağ sunucusu, internet üzerinde bir web sitesinin yayınından sorumlu olan sunucudur. Web server, Hosting ya da “barındırma” işlemini internet protokolü üzerinden sunan bir sunucudur. Barındırma ya da hosting, Web sayfalarını internette yayınlamak için gerekli alanın kiralanmasıdır. Diğer bir ifade ile hosting, bir Web sitesinde yayınlanmak istenen sayfaların, resimlerin veya dokümanların internet kullanıcıları tarafından erişebileceği bir bilgisayarda tutulmasıdır.

Terminal 	(GITHUB)
Terminal nedir

Terminal, Apple bilgisayarları ve Linux işletim sistemi kullanılan bilgisayarların içerisinde yer alan, kullanıcıların bir klavye ve ekran yardımıyla işletim sistemi yada yazılımları kontrol etmesine yardımcı olan komut ekranıdır. 

A terminal is simply a text-based interface to the computer. In a terminal, you can type commands, manipulate files, execute programs, and open documents. When working in a terminal, the current directory is called your working directory. A terminal will usually start in the top-level directory of your account.
Directories are separated by a backslash /. The topmost directory is indicated by a single backslash. The total directory tree is all relative to the top level directory.
On MacOS, there is a Volumes directory at the top that lists all mounted drives (networked or local). So if you have mounted your network directory, the path to it will look like the following if you substitute your username for mine.
/Volumes/Personal/bmaxwell
In a terminal, you generally type a command and any modifiers or arguments the command requires, then hit return and the command is executed. For example, to set your current (working) directory to your home directory, type cd and the prompt and hit return. Below is an example of a terminal and some commands.

Windows PowerShell 	(GITHUB)
Windows powershell nedir

To give you a better understanding of PowerShell, we should first define what a shell is. No, we're not talking about a turtle's shell. :) In computer science, a shell is a user interface that gives you access to various services of an operating system. A shell can be command-line based, or it can include a graphical user interface (GUI).
Windows PowerShell is a shell initially developed by Microsoft for the purposes of task automation and configuration management. PowerShell is now an open source project, and it can be installed on Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. This shell is based on the .NET framework, and it includes a command-line shell and a scripting language.

Windows PowerShell, Microsoft tarafından Windows komut satırı cmd.exe ve Windows Script Host'a alternatif olarak geliştirilen yeni nesil bir komut satırı uygulamasıdır. Windows PowerShell'in sunduğu yeni komut yapısı Unix sistemindeki komut yapısına benzemektedir. Kullanıcı herhangi bir komutu çalıştırdığında farklı komutlar ile bağ kurabilmektedir. Windows PowerShell 30 Kasım 2006'da ilk olarak Windows Vista işletim sisteminin bir parçası olarak planlanmıştır. Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 ile beraber ilk kez piyasaya sürülmüştür. Windows PowerShell 1.0 sürümü Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 ve Windows Vista için ücretsiz indirilebilmektedir. Windows 7'den itibaren Windows PowerShell 2.0 işletim sistemi ile beraber gelmektedir. Windows PowerShell 2.0 bir önceki sürümünden farklı olarak görsel kullanıcı arayüzüne sahptir.

Variable nedir, değişken nedir

Creating a variable reserves a memory location, or a space in memory, for storing values. 
To use a variable, it must first be declared by specifying the name and data type. 
A variable name, also called an identifier, can contain letters, numbers and the underscore character (_) and must start with a letter or underscore. 
For example, firstName and lastName are good descriptive variable names.

Json		(GITHUB)
json nedir
Json türündeki veriler iki parçadan oluşur: key (anahtar) ve value (değer). Anahtar’da nesnenin hangi özelliğinin olduğu (koddaki değişken ismi gibi düşünülebilir) tanımlanırken değerde ise anahtar özelliğinin değeri (değişkenin değeri) tanımlanır. Nesnelerdeki anahtar ve değerler string türünde tanımlanır. Aşağıda basit bir json nesnesi örneği bulunmaktadır.
{
   "Ad": "Veysel Uğur",
   "Soyad": "Kızmaz"
}


Detay:

What Is JSON?
JSON is short for JavaScript Object Notation, and is a way to store information in an organized, easy-to-access manner. In a nutshell, it gives us a human-readable collection of data that we can access in a really logical manner.
Storing JSON Data
As a simple example, information about me might be written in JSON as follows:
	var jason = {
		"age" : "24",
		"hometown" : "Missoula, MT",
		"gender" : "male"
	};
view rawgistfile1.js hosted with   by GitHub
This creates an object that we access using the variable jason. By enclosing the variable’s value in curly braces, we’re indicating that the value is an object. Inside the object, we can declare any number of properties using a "name": "value" pairing, separated by commas. To access the information stored in jason, we can simply refer to the name of the property we need. For instance, to access information about me, we could use the following snippets:
	document.write('Jason is ' jason.age); // Output: Jason is 24
	document.write('Jason is a ' jason.gender); // Output: Jason is a male
view rawgistfile1.js hosted with   by GitHub
Storing JSON Data in Arrays
A slightly more complicated example involves storing two people in one variable. To do this, we enclose multiple objects in square brackets, which signifies an array. For instance, if I needed to include information about myself and my brother in one variable, I might use the following:
	var family = [{
	    "name" : "Jason",
	    "age" : "24",
	    "gender" : "male"
	},
	{
	    "name" : "Kyle",
	    "age" : "21",
	    "gender" : "male"
	}];
view rawgistfile1.js hosted with   by GitHub
To access this information, we need to access the array index of the person we wish to access. For example, we would use the following snippet to access info stored in family:
	document.write(family[1].name); // Output: Kyle
	document.write(family[0].age); // Output: 24
view rawgistfile1.js hosted with   by GitHub
NOTE: This is beneficial if it will be necessary to loop through stored information, as it lends itself to a for loop with an automatically incrementing value.
Nesting JSON Data
Another way to store multiple people in our variable would be to nest objects. To do this, we would create something similar to the following:
	var family = {
	    "jason" : {
	        "name" : "Jason Lengstorf",
	        "age" : "24",
	        "gender" : "male"
	    },
	    "kyle" : {
	        "name" : "Kyle Lengstorf",
	        "age" : "21",
	        "gender" : "male"
	    }
	}
view rawgistfile1.js hosted with   by GitHub
Accessing information in nested objects is a little easier to understand; to access information in the object, we would use the following snippet:
	document.write(family.jason.name); // Output: Jason Lengstorf
	document.write(family.kyle.age); // Output: 21
	document.write(family.jason.gender); // Output: male
view rawgistfile1.js hosted with   by GitHub
Nested JSON and arrays can be combined as needed to store as much data as necessary.
Why Does JSON Matter?
With the rise of AJAX-powered sites, it’s becoming more and more important for sites to be able to load data quickly and asynchronously, or in the background without delaying page rendering. Switching up the contents of a certain element within our layouts without requiring a page refresh adds a “wow” factor to our applications, not to mention the added convenience for our users. Because of the popularity and ease of social media, many sites rely on the content provided by sites such as Twitter, Flickr, and others. These sites provide RSS feeds, which are easy to import and use on the server-side, but if we try to load them with AJAX, we run into a wall: we can only load an RSS feed if we’re requesting it from the same domain it’s hosted on. An attempt to load my Flickr account’s RSS feed via jQuery’s $.ajax() method results in the following JavaScript error:
	[Exception... "Access to restricted URI denied" code: "1012" 
	nsresult: "0x805303f4 (NS_ERROR_DOM_BAD_URI)" 
	location: "http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3.2/jquery.min.js Line: 19"]
view rawgistfile1.js hosted with   by GitHub
JSON allows us to overcome the cross-domain issue because we can use a method called JSONP that uses a callback function to send the JSON data back to our domain. It’s this capability that makes JSON so incredibly useful, as it opens up a lot of doors that were previously difficult to work around.
How Do We Load JSON into a Project?
One of the easiest ways to load JSON data into our web applications is to use the $.ajax() method available in the jQuery library. The ease of retrieving data will vary based on the site providing the data, but a simple example might look like this:
	$.ajax(
	    type:'GET',
	    url:"http://example.com/users/feeds/",
	    data:"format=json&id=123",
	    success:function(feed) {
	        document.write(feed);
	    },
	    dataType:'jsonp'
	);
view rawgistfile1.js hosted with   by GitHub
This example would request the latest feed items in JSON format and output them to the browser. Obviously, we wouldn’t want to output raw JSON data to the browser, but this example shows the basics of loading JSON from an external source.
A Practical Example: Loading Flickr Streams with JSON and jQuery
[demolink]See the Demo | Download the Source[/demolink]
To show how JSON works in a real-world example, let’s load photos from Flickr using jQuery and the JSON version of Flickr’s “Latest” photo feed.
Step 1: Create the AJAX Request
Flickr’s photostream feeds are relatively easy to access. All users have a unique ID number, which we will send as part of the request to this URL.
	http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne
view rawgistfile1.html hosted with   by GitHub
The request we need to send asks for the latest photos from the user in question, along with flags asking for a JSON-formatted response. The request we need to send will look like this:
	id=XXXXXXXX@NXX&lang=en-us&format=json&jsoncallback=?
view rawgistfile1.html hosted with   by GitHub
In the above example, XXXXXXXX@NXX needs to be replaced with the user’s ID. We’ll be writing a function, so the user’s ID will be passed as an argument called flickrID. Our function will be called loadFlickr(). Let’s create the function that will load our JSON response:
	function loadFlickr(flickrid)
	{
	    $('#feed').html('<span><img src="/blog/images/lightbox-ico-loading.gif" alt=""></span>');
	    $.ajax({
	        type:'GET',
	        url:"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne",
	        data:"id="+flickrid+"&lang=en-us&format=json&jsoncallback=?",
	        success:function(feed) {
	            // Do something with the response
	        },
	        dataType:'jsonp'
	    });
	}
view rawgistfile1.js hosted with   by GitHub
The returned JSON data will look something like this (note that I’ve removed all but one of the returned photos for the sake of brevity):
	({
	    "title": "Uploads from ennuidesign",
	    "link": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/ennuidesign/",

	    // The rest of the photo entries go here...
	 
	    ]
	})
view rawgistfile1.json hosted with   by GitHub
Step 2: Process the JSON Data
What we’re going to do is display the thumbnails of the latest 16 photos, which will link to the medium-sized display of the image. The Flickr JSON is a little confusing, and it doesn’t provide a direct link to the thumbnail version of our photos, so we’ll have to use some trickery on our end to get to it, which we’ll cover in just a moment. Each photo entry is stored in an array called items, which we access in our AJAX call using feed.items. To get to the data about each entry, we’ll loop through the items until we’ve either hit the last available photo or 16 total photos; whichever comes first. Let’s modify our function and set up the loop:
	function loadFlickr(flickrid)
	{
	    // Display a loading icon in our display element
	    $('#feed').html('<span><img src="/blog/images/lightbox-ico-loading.gif" alt=""></span>');
	 
	    // Request the JSON and process it
	    $.ajax({
	        type:'GET',
	        url:"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne",
	        data:"id="+flickrid+"&lang=en-us&format=json&jsoncallback=?",
	        success:function(feed) {
	            // Create an empty array to store images
	            var thumbs = [];
	 
	            // Loop through the items
	            for(var i=0, l=feed.items.length; i < l && i < 16;   i) 
	            {
	                // Process each image
	            }
	 
	            // Display the thumbnails on the page
	        },
	        dataType:'jsonp'
	    });
	}

The element we’re interested in is the “m” element stored within the “media” element. This can be accessed within our loop using feed.items[i].media.m. We’re going to run a regular expression on this value to get both the medium and thumbnail image paths, which we’ll assemble into a linked thumbnail image. Then, we’ll push the newly assembled HTML into the array of thumbs we created. After we’ve finished the loop, we’ll combine all the images into one string of HTML and replace the contents of our display element with the loaded thumbnails. Let’s add this functionality to our script:
	function loadFlickr(flickrid)
	{
	    // Display a loading icon in our display element
	    $('#feed').html('<span><img src="/blog/images/lightbox-ico-loading.gif" alt=""></span>');
	 
	    // Request the JSON and process it
	    $.ajax({
	        type:'GET',
	        url:"http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne",
	        data:"id="+flickrid+"&lang=en-us&format=json&jsoncallback=?",
	        success:function(feed) {
	            // Create an empty array to store images
	            var thumbs = [];
	 
	            // Loop through the items
	            for(var i=0, l=feed.items.length; i < l && i < 16;   i) 
	            {
	                // Manipulate the image to get thumb and medium sizes
	                var img = feed.items[i].media.m.replace(
	                    /^(.*?)_m.jpg$/, 
	                    '<a href="/blog/$1.jpg"><img src="/blog/$1_s.jpg" alt=""></a>'
	                );
	 
	                // Add the new element to the array
	                thumbs.push(img);
	            }
	 
	            // Display the thumbnails on the page
	            $('#feed').html(thumbs.join(''));
	 
	            // A function to add a lightbox effect
	            addLB();
	        },
	        dataType:'jsonp'
	    });
	}

Note that I’ve also added a function called addLB() to the end of this function; this adds the lightbox effect to our thumbnails, which is purely for aesthetics.
Step 3: Call Our Function
At this point, we’re ready to call our function. To load my Flickr stream, we would need to call our function as follows:
	loadFlickr("29080075@N02");

The example posted will pull multiple users’ photostreams into the containing box without causing a page refresh. Look at the source code on the demo to see how it was done. NOTE: Keep in mind that this demo was to show how to load JSON data, and not on how to implement the code to call the function. The JavaScript calls are inline, which should NOT be used in a production script.

SharePoint 
sharepoint nedir
SharePoint is a web-based collaborative platform that integrates with Microsoft Office. Launched in 2001, SharePoint is primarily sold as a document management and storage system, but the product is highly configurable and usage varies substantially among organizations.
Microsoft states that SharePoint has 190 million users across 200,000 customer organizations.
There are the Windows SharePoint Services (WSS), the Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) and Microsoft Search Server. Each bring their own functionalities to the table and build upon each other. 
When looking up what SharePoint is, you get a lot of different answers from the Internet:
•	Microsoft SharePoint is a browser-based collaboration and document management platform from Microsoft - Wikipedia
•	Microsoft's content management system. It allows groups to set up a centralized, password protected space for document sharing. Documents can be stored, downloaded and edited, then uploaded for continued sharing. - SAIT Polytechnic Teaching - Glossary
•	SharePoint is a web-based intranet that can help improve your organization's effectiveness by streamlining the management of and access to data. - Creative SharePoint
•	SharePoint is an enterprise information portal, from Microsoft, that can be configured to run Intranet, Extranet and Internet sites. - SharePoint HQ
•	{..} SharePoint is a sort of sharing/blogging/wiki-style server that mainly provides a back end to Microsoft Office - Jack Schofield, Technical Writer Guardian newspaper, UK.
So what is SharePoint? Let's first look at it from a technical perspective. There are the Windows SharePoint Services (WSS), the Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) and Microsoft Search Server. Each bring their own functionality to the table and build upon each other.
Windows SharePoint Services function the basic functionality that Gartner calls Basic Content Services. It offers the user access to Versioning and Check-in/Checkout functionality. WSS can then be extended through the use of the applets to add additional collaborative functions like email alerts, shared calendars, etc.
Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) sits on top of WSS and adds additional features, both to the underlying WSS layer as well as additional ways for the end-user to interact with the repository. The data resides in a SQL Database. Using Webparts it can then present this information to the user using a wide range of different modules and for interaction in different business scenarios. These include such diverse applications as Collaboration, Document management, Records Management (including DOD 5015.2 certified components), Workflow, Personalization, more complex metadata models as well as Blogs and Wikis from the Web 2.0 side.

Difference between readonly and const keyword in C#  	 (GITHUB)
const nedir, readonly nedir  
In C#, a const keyword is used to declare constant fields and constant local. The value of the constant field is the same throughout the program or in other words, once the constant field is assigned the value of this field is not be changed. In C#, constant fields and locals are not variables, a constant is a number, string, null reference, boolean values.

Example:
// C# program to illustrate the 
// use of const keyword 
using System; 
  
class GFG { 
  
    // Constant fields 
    public const int myvar = 10; 
    public const string str = "GeeksforGeeks"; 
  
    // Main method 
    static public void Main() 
    { 
  
        // Display the value of Constant fields 
        Console.WriteLine("The value of myvar: {0}", myvar); 
        Console.WriteLine("The value of str: {0}", str); 
    } 
} 
Output:



The value of myvar: 10
The value of str: GeeksforGeeks
In C#, you can use a readonly keyword to declare a readonly variable. This readonly keyword shows that you can assign the variable only when you declare a variable or in a constructor of the same class in which it is declared.
Example:
filter_none
edit
play_arrow
brightness_4
// C# program to illustrate the use  
// of the readonly keyword 
using System; 
  
class GFG { 
  
    // readonly variables 
    public readonly int myvar1; 
    public readonly int myvar2; 
  
    // Values of the readonly  
    // variables are assigned 
    // Using constructor 
    public GFG(int b, int c) 
    { 
  
        myvar1 = b; 
        myvar2 = c; 
        Console.WriteLine("Display value of myvar1 {0}, "+ 
                        "and myvar2 {1}", myvar1, myvar2); 
    } 
  
    // Main method 
    static public void Main() 
    { 
        GFG obj1 = new GFG(100, 200); 
    } 
} 
Output:
Display value of myvar1 100, and myvar2 200

readonly Modifier

[readonly nedir, readonly modifier nedir, readonly keyword nedir, const nedir]

The readonly modifier prevents a member of a class from being modified after construction. It means that the field declared as readonly can be modified only when you declare it or from within a constructor.

        class Person
        {
            private readonly string name = "John";
            public Person(string name)
            {
                this.name = name;
            }
        }
If we try to modify the name field anywhere else, we will get an error.

There are three major differences between readonly and const fields. 
First, a constant field must be initialized when it is declared, whereas a readonly field can be declared without initialization, as in:

        readonly string name; // OK
        const double PI; // Error
 
Second, a readonly field value can be changed in a constructor, but a constant value cannot.
Third, the readonly field can be assigned a value that is a result of a calculation, but constants cannot, as in:

        readonly double a = Math.Sin(60); // OK
        const double b = Math.Sin(60); // Error

this Keyword	    (GITHUB)

this nedir, this keyword nedir
The this keyword is used inside the class and refers to the current instance of the class, meaning it refers to the current object.
One of the common uses of this is to distinguish class members from other data, such as local or formal parameters of a method, as shown in the following example:
        class Person
        {
            private string name;
            public Person(string name)
            {
                this.name = name; // member of the class
            }
        }

Here, this.name represents the member of the class, whereas name represents the parameter of the constructor.

Another common use of this is for passing the current instance to a method as parameter: ShowPersonInfo(this);

Initialization (GITHUB)
Initialization nedir
Object'in property'lerini objenin creation time'ında Set etmeye yarar. Yani objeyi üretirken property'lerini set etmeye yarayan bir şeydir (neydir? Bir Special Feature'dir [pluralsight]

        public class Employee
        {

        }

        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Employee emp = new Employee(); // null dönmeyecektir.. initialize ettik. Constructor kullandık. Ne olmuş oldu? emp üretilmiş oldu... Hatırlayalım ki constructor kullanıldığı zaman yeni obje (instance) üretilmiş olur.
            Employee emp2; // null dönecektir.

            Console.WriteLine(emp); // hata üretmez
            Console.WriteLine(emp2); // HATA! Might not be initialized before accessing.

            Console.ReadLine();
	}
Initialization MSDN anlatımı:
Local variables in C# must be initialized before they are used. For example, you might declare a local variable without initialization as in the following example:
            int myInt; // Declaration
You cannot use it before you initialize it. You can initialize it using the following statement:
            myInt = new int();  // Initialization // Invoke default constructor for int type.
This statement is equivalent to the following statement:

            myInt = 0;         // Assign an initial value, 0 in this example.  
You can, of course, have the declaration and the initialization in the same statement as in the following examples:
            int myInt = new int(); // declaration and the initialization
–or–
            int myInt = 0; // declaration and the initialization
Using the new operator calls the default constructor of the specific type and assigns the default value to the variable. In the preceding example, the default constructor assigned the value 0 to myInt. For more information about values assigned by calling default constructors, see Default Values Table.
With user-defined types, use new to invoke the default constructor. For example, the following statement invokes the default constructor of the Point struct: 

            Point p = new Point(); // Invoke default constructor for the struct.  

After this call, the struct is considered to be definitely assigned; that is, all its members are initialized to their default values.
Örnek:
  int myInt = new int(); // 0 dönüyor
            int otherInt; // 0 dönüyor //initialize etmediğimiz halde 0 değerini aldı. String'de null değer alabildi. Neden int null alamadı? Cevabı aşağıdaki notta: Reference type value type olayı!
            //int otherInt2 = null; // hata verir. Cannot convert null to int.

            //string myString = new string(); // böyle bir şey yazamazsın. Hata verir.
            string otherString; // null dönüyor
            string otherString2 = null; // null dönüyor

// int is a primitive type and only ReferenceTypes (objects) are nullable.
// not2: An int is a value type. It is really of type Int32. Objects that can be nullable are reference types. At a basic level the difference is that a value type will store the value with the variable where a reference type will store a reference to the value. A reference can be null, meaning that it doesn't point to a value. Where a value type always has a value.
Nullable wraps a value type to allow you to have the option of being null. Using int? is just a compiler shortcut to declare a nullable type.
// not3: int is a value type, which can only hold a value...

ArrayList Class  (GITHUB)
arrayList nedir
Implements the IList interface using an array whose size is dynamically increased as required.
The following example shows how to create and initialize an ArrayList and how to display its values.
using System;
using System.Collections;
public class SamplesArrayList  {

   public static void Main()  {

      // Creates and initializes a new ArrayList.
      ArrayList myAL = new ArrayList();
      myAL.Add("Hello");
      myAL.Add("World");
      myAL.Add("!");

      // Displays the properties and values of the ArrayList.
      Console.WriteLine( "myAL" );
      Console.WriteLine( "    Count:    {0}", myAL.Count );
      Console.WriteLine( "    Capacity: {0}", myAL.Capacity );
      Console.Write( "    Values:" );
      PrintValues( myAL );
   }

   public static void PrintValues( IEnumerable myList )  {
      foreach ( Object obj in myList )
         Console.Write( "   {0}", obj );
      Console.WriteLine();
   }

}


/* 
This code produces output similar to the following:

myAL
    Count:    3
    Capacity: 4
    Values:   Hello   World   !

*/

 Important
We don't recommend that you use the ArrayList class for new development. Instead, we recommend that you use the generic List<T> class. The ArrayList class is designed to hold heterogeneous collections of objects. However, it does not always offer the best performance. Instead, we recommend the following:
•	For a heterogeneous collection of objects, use the List<Object> (in C#) or List(Of Object) (in Visual Basic) type.
•	For a homogeneous collection of objects, use the List<T> class.
See Performance Considerations in the List<T> reference topic for a discussion of the relative performance of these classes. See Non-generic collections shouldn't be used on GitHub for general information on the use of generic instead of non-generic collection types.
The ArrayList is not guaranteed to be sorted. You must sort the ArrayList by calling its Sort method prior to performing operations (such as BinarySearch) that require the ArrayList to be sorted. To maintain a collection that is automatically sorted as new elements are added, you can use the SortedSet<T> class.
The capacity of an ArrayList is the number of elements the ArrayList can hold. As elements are added to an ArrayList, the capacity is automatically increased as required through reallocation. The capacity can be decreased by calling TrimToSize or by setting the Capacity property explicitly.
.NET Framework only: For very large ArrayList objects, you can increase the maximum capacity to 2 billion elements on a 64-bit system by setting the enabled attribute of the <gcAllowVeryLargeObjects> configuration element to true in the run-time environment.
Elements in this collection can be accessed using an integer index. Indexes in this collection are zero-based.
The ArrayList collection accepts null as a valid value. It also allows duplicate elements.
Using multidimensional arrays as elements in an ArrayList collection is not supported.

Strongly Typed 	(GITHUB)
Strongly Typed nedir? Strongly type nedir, weakly typed nedir, loosely typed nedir
A LANGUAGE IS STRONGLY TYPED if the compiler can guarantee that the accepted programs will execute without type errors. Lisp languages are usually weakly typed:

C# is a strongly-typed language. It means we must declare the type of a variable which indicates the kind of values it is going to store such as integer, float, decimal, text, etc.
The following declares and initialized variables of different data types.
Example: Variables of Different Data Types

string stringVar = "Hello World!!";
int intVar = 100;
float floatVar = 10.2f;
char charVar = 'A';
bool boolVar = true;
 
In computer programming, programming languages are often colloquially classified as to whether the language's type system makes it strongly typed or weakly typed (loosely typed). Generally, a strongly typed language has stricter typing rules at compile time, which implies that errors and exceptions are more likely to happen during compilation. However, dynamically typed languages (where type checking happens at run time) can also be strongly typed. Most of these rules affect variable assignment, return values and function calling. On the other hand, a weakly typed language has looser typing rules and may produce unpredictable results or may perform implicit type conversion at runtime.[1] A different but related concept is latent typing.

Declarative Programming / Imperative Programming  (GITHUB)

Declarative nedir, imperative nedir, declarative programming nedir, imperative programming nedir

In computer science, declarative programming is a programming paradigm that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.

Declarative programming is when you say what you want, and imperative language is when you say how to get what you want.


İmperative: Emir verebilirsin


Imperative programming, anlaşılacağı üzere Emirli. 

Imperative: NASIL yapacağım diye sorar. Kontrol akışı vardır.

Declarative: NE yapacağım diye sorar. Kontrol akışı tanımlamaz, direk computation’a odaklanır.

Resmi incele.

Value type olanlar (örneğin int) ---> Stack içinde saklanır.
Pointer'lar da Stack içinde saklanır.
Ama objeler Heap içinde saklanır.

Yani neymiş, örneğin Report report = new Report(); deyince; buradaki report, (YANİ OBJE DEĞİL, POINTER!) -- STACK içinde tutuluyor. AMA report aracılığıyla üretilen yeni OBJE HEAP'TE TUTULUYOR. Güzel bilgi bu… 
Dikkat et… report dediğin şey bir pointer'dir, objenin kendisi değildir. Inıtialize yapıyorsan bu pointer gidip bir OBJE üretecektir. Ama kendisi, yani report, o yeni üretilen objeye işaret eden bir pointer'dir.

Report report2 = report; deyince görüldüğü üzere yeni bir obje üretmedik. Zaten initialization olmadığı belli… new Report(); deyip constructor çalıştırmadık veya bir property'sine bir değer atamadık. Yani yeni bir obje oluşmamış oldu. Yani aynı referansı tutuyor report ile…..

SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) Principles    (GITHUB)
Soa nedir, service oriented architecture nedir
SOA is based on some key principles which are mentioned below
1.	Standardized Service Contract - Services adhere to a service description. A service must have some sort of description which describes what the service is about. This makes it easier for client applications to understand what the service does.
2.	Loose Coupling – (geniş bir yere yayılmış insanlar düşün, yani birbirlerinden uzaklar, birbirlerine bağımlı değiller). Less dependency on each other. This is one of the main characteristics of web services which just states that there should be as less dependency as possible between the web services and the client invoking the web service. So if the service functionality changes at any point in time, it should not break the client application or stop it from working.
3.	Service Abstraction - Services hide the logic they encapsulate from the outside world. The service should not expose how it executes its functionality; it should just tell the client application on what it does and not on how it does it.
4.	Service Reusability - Logic is divided into services with the intent of maximizing reuse. In any development company re-usability is a big topic because obviously one wouldn't want to spend time and effort building the same code again and again across multiple applications which require them. Hence, once the code for a web service is written it should have the ability work with various application types.
5.	Service Autonomy - Services should have control over the logic they encapsulate. The service knows everything on what functionality it offers and hence should also have complete control over the code it contains.
6.	Service Statelessness - Ideally, services should be stateless. This means that services should not withhold information from one state to the other. This would need to be done from either the client application. An example can be an order placed on a shopping site. Now you can have a web service which gives you the price of a particular item. But if the items are added to a shopping cart and the web page navigates to the page where you do the payment, the responsibility of the price of the item to be transferred to the payment page should not be done by the web service. Instead, it needs to be done by the web application.
7.	Service Discoverability - Services can be discovered (usually in a service registry). We have already seen this in the concept of the UDDI, which performs a registry which can hold information about the web service.
8.	Service Composability - Services break big problems into little problems. One should never embed all functionality of an application into one single service but instead, break the service down into modules each with a separate business functionality.
9.	Service Interoperability - Services should use standards that allow diverse subscribers to use the service. In web services, standards as XML and communication over HTTP is used to ensure it conforms to this principle.

Stack
Stack nedir

Stack bir data tipidir; ama abstract bir data tipidir.

In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations:
•	push, which adds an element to the collection, and
•	pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.
 
Örnek:

Stack myStack = new Stack();
myStack.Push("Hello!!");
myStack.Push(null);
myStack.Push(1);
myStack.Push(2);

In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. 

Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.
The term is often used in contrast to declarative programming, which focuses on what the program should accomplish without specifying how the program should achieve the result.

In computer science, declarative programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow. 

Declarative Programming devam: Many languages that apply this style attempt to minimize or eliminate side effects by describing what the program must accomplish in terms of the problem domain, rather than describe how to accomplish it as a sequence of the programming language primitives[2](the how being left up to the language's implementation). This is in contrast with imperative programming, which implements algorithms in explicit steps.

Declarative Query Languages: Definition and Examples (GITHUB)

Some well-known general declarative programming languages include Ruby, R and Haskell. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a declarative query language and is the industry standard for relational databases.
Declarative query nedir, declarative query language nedir
The two main paradigms of database query languages are imperative and declarative. Understanding the difference between these two approaches is essential if you’re going to be successful in database development.

If the query languages were human archetypes, imperative languages would be the micromanaging boss who gives instructions down to the final detail.

In the most basic sense, imperative query languages are used to describe how you want something done specifically. This is accomplished with explicit control in a detailed, step-by step manner; the sequence and wording of each line of code plays a critical role.

Some well-known general imperative programming languages include Python, C and Java.

In the world of graph database technology, there aren’t any purely imperative query languages. However, both Gremlin and the Java API (for Neo4j) include imperative features. These two options provide you with more detailed power over the execution of their task. If written correctly, there are no surprises – you will get exactly what you want done.

However, imperative database query languages can also be limiting and not very user-friendly, requiring an extensive knowledge of the language and deep technical understanding of physical implementation details prior to usage. Writing one part incorrectly creates faulty outcomes.

As a result, imperative languages are more prone to human error. Additionally, users must double-check the environment before and after the query and be prepared to deal with any potential erroneous scenarios.

To better illustrate the differences, imagine you have two children: Isabel and Duncan. Isabel represents an imperative query language and Duncan the declarative query language.

To get the two children to make their beds, you take differing approaches. For Duncan, it is easy. Simply instruct Duncan to make his bed and he will do it however he sees fit. Yet, he might make it differently than you had in mind, especially if you’re a picky parent.

Isabel requires an entirely different process. You must first inform her that she needs both sheets and blankets to make her bed, and that those materials are found on top of her bed. Then she requires step-by-step instructions, such as “spread the sheet over the mattress” and “tuck in the edges.”

The final result will be closely similar to Duncan’s (or perhaps, exactly the same). At the end of the process, both children have their beds made.

Declarative Query Languages: Definition and Examples

All too often, declarative query languages are often defined as being any database query language that is not imperative. However, to define it in such a manner is too broad.

Declarative query languages let users express what data to retrieve, letting the engine underneath take care of seamlessly retrieving it. They function in a more general manner and involve giving broad instructions about what task is to be completed, rather than the specifics on how to complete it. They deal with the results rather than the process, focusing less on the finer details of each task.

Some well-known general declarative programming languages include Ruby, R and Haskell. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a declarative query language and is the industry standard for relational databases.

Using a declarative database query language may also result in better code than what can be created manually, and it is usually easier to understand the purpose of the code written in a declarative language. Declarative query languages are also easier to use as they simply focus on what must be retrieved and do so quickly.

However, declarative languages have their own trade-offs. Users have little to no control over how inputs are dealt with; if there is a bug in the language, the user will have to rely on the providers of the language to fix the problem. Likewise, if the user wants to use a function that the query language doesn’t support, they are often at a loss.

In the previous example of the children, Duncan was able to complete his task in a method faster and easier for his parent than Isabel. However, imagine now that you want to them to wash the dishes.

It is the same process for Isabel: You’d need to walk through each step with her so she can learn how the process works.

For Duncan, however, we have hit a snag. Duncan has never learned how to wash the dishes. You will stay in that impasse with Duncan unless his programming engineers decide to teach him how to wash the dishes. (Duncan isn’t like most children.)

Conclusion

You should select the best query language paradigm for your specific use case. Neither paradigm is better than the other; they each have different strengths for software development.

If your project requires finer accuracy and control, imperative query languages do the job well. If the speed and productivity of the development process matter more, declarative languages offer the flexibility of getting results without as much effort. Ultimately, the choice depends on you.

LINQ  (GITHUB)
Linq nedir
Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) is the name for a set of technologies based on the integration of query capabilities directly into the C# language. Traditionally, queries against data are expressed as simple strings without type checking at compile time or IntelliSense support. Furthermore, you have to learn a different query language for each type of data source: SQL databases, XML documents, various Web services, and so on. With LINQ, a query is a first-class language construct, just like classes, methods, events. You write queries against strongly typed collections of objects by using language keywords and familiar operators. The LINQ family of technologies provides a consistent query experience for objects (LINQ to Objects), relational databases (LINQ to SQL), and XML (LINQ to XML).
For a developer who writes queries, the most visible "language-integrated" part of LINQ is the query expression. Query expressions are written in a declarative query syntax. By using query syntax, you can perform filtering, ordering, and grouping operations on data sources with a minimum of code. You use the same basic query expression patterns to query and transform data in SQL databases, ADO .NET Datasets, XML documents and streams, and .NET collections.
You can write LINQ queries in C# for SQL Server databases, XML documents, ADO.NET Datasets, and any collection of objects that supports IEnumerable or the generic IEnumerable<T> interface. LINQ support is also provided by third parties for many Web services and other database implementations.
The following example shows the complete query operation. The complete operation includes creating a data source, defining the query expression, and executing the query in a foreach statement.
C#Copy
class LINQQueryExpressions
{
    static void Main()
    {
        
        // Specify the data source.
        int[] scores = new int[] { 97, 92, 81, 60 };

        // Define the query expression.
        IEnumerable<int> scoreQuery =
            from score in scores
            where score > 80
            select score;

        // Execute the query.
        foreach (int i in scoreQuery)
        {
            Console.Write(i + " ");
        }            
    }
}
// Output: 97 92 81
The following illustration from Visual Studio shows a partially-completed LINQ query against a SQL Server database in both C# and Visual Basic with full type checking and IntelliSense support:
 
Query expression overview
•	Query expressions can be used to query and to transform data from any LINQ-enabled data source. For example, a single query can retrieve data from a SQL database, and produce an XML stream as output.
•	Query expressions are easy to master because they use many familiar C# language constructs.
•	The variables in a query expression are all strongly typed, although in many cases you do not have to provide the type explicitly because the compiler can infer it. For more information, see Type relationships in LINQ query operations.
•	A query is not executed until you iterate over the query variable, for example, in a foreach statement. For more information, see Introduction to LINQ queries.
•	At compile time, query expressions are converted to Standard Query Operator method calls according to the rules set forth in the C# specification. Any query that can be expressed by using query syntax can also be expressed by using method syntax. However, in most cases query syntax is more readable and concise. For more information, see C# language specification and Standard query operators overview.
•	As a rule when you write LINQ queries, we recommend that you use query syntax whenever possible and method syntax whenever necessary. There is no semantic or performance difference between the two different forms. Query expressions are often more readable than equivalent expressions written in method syntax.
•	Some query operations, such as Count or Max, have no equivalent query expression clause and must therefore be expressed as a method call. Method syntax can be combined with query syntax in various ways. For more information, see Query syntax and method syntax in LINQ.
•	Query expressions can be compiled to expression trees or to delegates, depending on the type that the query is applied to. IEnumerable<T> queries are compiled to delegates. IQueryable and IQueryable<T> queries are compiled to expression trees. For more information, see Expression trees.

Runtime vs Compile time
Runtime nedir, compile time nedir,  run time nedir, compile nedir
Runtime and compile time are programming terms that refer to different stages of software program development. Compile-time is the instance where the code you entered is converted to executable while Run-time is the instance where the executable is running. The terms "runtime" and "compile time" are often used by programmers to refer to different types of errors too.
Compile-time checking occurs during the compile time. Compile time errors are error occurred due to typing mistake, if we do not follow the proper syntax and semantics of any programming language then compile time errors are thrown by the compiler. They wont let your program to execute a single line until you remove all the syntax errors or until you debug the compile time errors. The following are usual compile time errors:
	Syntax errors
	Typechecking errors
	Compiler crashes (Rarely)
Run-time type checking happens during run time of programs. Runtime errors are the errors that are generated when the program is in running state. These types of errors will cause your program to behave unexpectedly or may even kill your program. They are often referred as Exceptions . The following are some usual runtime errors:
	Division by zero
	Dereferencing a null pointer
	Running out of memory

Stateless - Stateful
stateless nedir, stateful nedir
Stateful and stateless are adjectives that describe whether a computer or computer program is designed to note and remember one or more preceding events in a given sequence of interactions with a user, another computer or program, a device, or other outside element. 
Stateful means the computer or program keeps track of the state of interaction, usually by setting values in a storage field designated for that purpose. 
Stateless means there is no record of previous interactions and each interaction request has to be handled based entirely on information that comes with it. 
Stateful and stateless are derived from the usage of state as a set of conditions at a moment in time. (Computers are inherently stateful in operation, so these terms are used in the context of a particular set of interactions, not of how computers work in general.)
The Internet's basic protocol, the Internet Protocol ( IP ), is an example of a stateless interaction. Each packet travels entirely on its own without reference to any other packet. When you request a Web page from a Web site, the request travels in one or more packets, each independent of the other as far as the Internet Protocol program itself is concerned. (The upper layer Transmission Control Protocol - TCP - does relate packets to each other, but uses the information within the packet rather than some external information to do this.) The term connectionless is also used to describe communication in which a connection is made and terminated for each message that is sent. IP is connectionless as well as stateless.
The Web's Hypertext Transfer Protocol ( HTTP ), an application layer above TCP/IP, is also stateless. Each request from a user for a Web page or URL results in the requested pages being served, but without the Web (HTTP) server remembering the request later. In other words, there is no recorded continuity. Each communication is discrete and unrelated to those that precede or follow. In order to have stateful communication, a site developer must furnish a special program that the server can call that can record and retrieve state information. Web browsers such as Netscape Explorer and Microsoft Internet Explorer provide an area in their subdirectories where state information can be stored and accessed. The area and the information that Web browsers and server applications put in this area is called a cookie .
In formal protocol specifications, a finite state machine is an abstract desciption of how a stateful system works that describes the action that follows each possible state.
The Internet (including the World Wide Web) can be thought of as a stateless system or machine. Most computers, human beings, and elephants are stateful.

Query String
Query string nedir, stateless nedir
ÇOK ÖNEMLİ TEXT:
A query string is the portion of a URL where data is passed to a web application and/or back-end database. The reason we need query strings is that the HTTP protocol is stateless by design. For a website to be anything more than a brochure, you need to maintain state (store data). 
There are a number of ways to do this: On most web servers, you can use something like session state server-side. On the client, you can store via cookies. Or in the URL, you can store data via a query string. 

On the world wide web, all URLs can be broken down into the protocol, the location of the file (or program) and the query string. The protocol you see in a browser is almost always HTTP; the location is the typical form of the hostname and filename (for example, www.techopedia.com/somefile.html), and the query string is whatever follows the question mark sign ("?").
For example, in the URL below, the bolded area is the query string that was generated when the term "database" was searched on the Techopedia website.
//www.techopedia.com/search.aspx?q=database§ion=all

IIS- Internet Information Services  (GITHUB)
IIS nedir, iis nedir
Stands for "Internet Information Services." IIS is a web server software package designed for Windows Server. It is used for hosting websites and other content on the Web.
Microsoft’s Internet Information Services provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing websites and the associated users. It provides a visual means of creating, configuring, and publishing sites on the web. The IIS Manager tool allows web administrators to modify website options, such as default pages, error pages, logging settings, security settings, and performance optimizations.
IIS can serve both standard HTML webpages and dynamic webpages, such as ASP.NET applications and PHP pages. When a visitor accesses a page on a static website, IIS simply sends the HTML and associated images to the user’s browser. When a page on a dynamic website is accessed, IIS runs any applications and processes any scripts contained in the page, then sends the resulting data to the user’s browser.
While IIS includes all the features necessary to host a website, it also supports extensions (or “modules”) that add extra functionality to the server. For example, the WinCache Extension enables PHP scripts to run faster by caching PHP processes. The URL Rewrite module allows webmasters to publish pages with friendly URLs that are easier for visitors to type and remember. A streaming extension can be installed to provide streaming media to website visitors.
IIS is a popular option for commercial websites, since it offers many advanced features and is supported by Microsoft. However, it also requires requires a commercial license and the pricing increases depending on the number of users. Therefore, Apache HTTP Server, which is open source and free for unlimited users, remains the most popular web server software.

Internet Information Service (IIS), Microsoft firmasının Windows işletim sistemlerinde ve sunucularında kullandığı, Web servisini sunan alt yazılımdır.

CakePHP 	(GITHUB)
CakePHP is an open-source web framework. It follows the model–view–controller (MVC) approach and is written in PHP, modeled after the concepts of Ruby on Rails, and distributed under the MIT License.

CakePHP uses well-known software engineering concepts and software design patterns, such as convention over configuration, model–view–controller, active record, association data mapping, and front controller.

CakePHP started in April 2005, when a Polish programmer Michal Tatarynowicz[3] wrote a minimal version of a rapid application development framework in PHP, dubbing it Cake.[4][5][6] He published the framework under the MIT license, and opened it up to the online community of developers. In December 2005, L. Masters and G. J. Woodworth founded the Cake Software Foundation to promote development related to CakePHP.[6] Version 1.0 was released in May 2006.

One of the project's inspirations was Ruby on Rails, using many of its concepts. The community has since grown and spawned several sub-projects.

Encapsulation
encapsulation nedir
Encapsulation is implemented by using access specifiers. An access specifier defines the scope and visibility of a class member. C# supports the following access specifiers −
•	Public
•	Private
•	Protected
•	Internal
•	Protected internal

Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. In a different way, encapsulation is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.
•	Technically in encapsulation, the variables or data of a class are hidden from any other class and can be accessed only through any member function of own class in which they are declared.
•	As in encapsulation, the data in a class is hidden from other classes, so it is also known as data-hiding.
•	Encapsulation can be achieved by: Declaring all the variables in the class as private and using C# Properties in the class to set and get the values of variables.
 

using System;
  
public class DemoEncap
{
    // private variables declared 
    // these can only be accessed by public methods of class 
    private String studentName;
    private int studentAge;
 
    // using accessors to get and set the value of studentName 
    public String Name
    {
        get
        {
            return studentName;
        }
 
        set
        {
            studentName = value;
        }
    }
 
    // using accessors to get and set the value of studentAge 
    public int Age
    {
        get
        {
            return studentAge;
        }
 
        set
        {
            studentAge = value;
        }
    }
}
 
// Driver Class 
class GFG
{
 
    // Main Method 
    static public void Main()
    {
 
        // creating object 
        DemoEncap obj = new DemoEncap();
 
        // calls set accessor of the property Name,  
        // and pass "Ankita" as value of the  
        // standard field 'value' 
        obj.Name = "Ankita";
 
        // calls set accessor of the property Age,  
        // and pass "21" as value of the  
        // standard field 'value' 
        obj.Age = 21;
 
        // Displaying values of the variables 
        Console.WriteLine("Name: " + obj.Name);
        Console.WriteLine("Age: " + obj.Age);
    }
}

 
Output:
Name: Ankita
Age: 21
Explanation: In the above program the class DemoEncap is encapsulated as the variables are declared as private. To access these private variables we are using the Name and Age accessors which contains the get and set method to retrieve and set the values of private fields. Accessors are defined as public so that they can access in other class.

Advantages of Encapsulation:
•	Data Hiding: The user will have no idea about the inner implementation of the class. It will not be visible to the user that how the class is stored values in the variables. He only knows that we are passing the values to accessors and variables are getting initialized to that value.
•	Increased Flexibility: We can make the variables of the class as read-only or write-only depending on our requirement. If we wish to make the variables as read-only then we have to only use Get Accessor in the code. If we wish to make the variables as write-only then we have to only use Set Accessor.
•	Reusability: Encapsulation also improves the re-usability and easy to change with new requirements.
•	Testing code is easy: Encapsulated code is easy to test for unit testing.

Result set nedir
An SQL result set is a set of rows from a database, as well as metadata about the query such as the column names, and the types and sizes of each column. Depending on the database system, the number of rows in the result set may or may not be known. Usually, this number is not known up front because the result set is built on-the-fly.

A result set is effectively a table. The ORDER BY clause can be used in a query to impose a certain sort condition on the rows. Without that clause, there is no guarantee whatsoever on the order in which the rows are returned.

MySQL, MsSQL, T-SQL, Oracle, PL-SQL 	(GITHUB) (read -ama tekrar)
MySQL nedir, MsSQL nedir, T-SQL nedir, t sql nedir, tsql nedir, oracle nedir, plsql nedir, pl-sql nedir, pl/sql nedir
SQL is a database language used with Oracle Database.
MySQL is a database itself that uses SQL language.
Biz T-SQL üzerinden çalışıyoruz (MSSQL'de), peki MySQL nedir?
MySQL is free and open-source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License, and is also available under a variety of proprietary licenses. MySQL was owned and sponsored by the Swedish company MySQL AB, which was bought by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle Corporation).MySQL is pronounced as "my ess-que-ell," in contrast with SQL, pronounced "sequel."
MySQL is supporting many different platforms including Microsoft Windows, the major Linux distributions, UNIX, and Mac OS X.
MySQL has free and paid versions, depending on its usage (non-commercial/commercial) and features. MySQL comes with a very fast, multi-threaded, multi-user and robust SQL database server.

MS SQL 
MsSQL Server is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft Inc. Its primary query languages are − T-SQL, ANSI SQL

Oracle
It is a very large multi-user based database management system. Oracle is a relational database management system developed by 'Oracle Corporation'.

Oracle works to efficiently manage its resources, a database of information among the multiple clients requesting and sending data in the network.
It is an excellent database server choice for client/server computing. Oracle supports all major operating systems for both clients and servers, including MSDOS, NetWare, UnixWare, OS/2 and most UNIX flavors.

Oracle ile MYSQL arasındaki farklar üzerine:
SQL is a database language used with Oracle Database.
MySQL is a database itself that uses SQL language.
The difference is that MySQL is free, and the world's most popular database, and Oracle isn't free (except with trials and certain products) and makes billions from selling premium database software to large enterprises and SME.

There are many more differences between Oracle and MySQL.We can summarise them as follows-
1.Oracle is way more powerful than MySQL
2.Oracle supports distributed databases while MySQL doesn’t
3.Oracle supports save points while MySQL doesn’t
4.Oracle allows programs within the database while MySQL doesn’t
5.Oracle is suited for enterprise deployments while MySQL is suited for small to medium scale
6.Oracle requires that you pay a licensing fee while MySQL doesn’t

-- Daha anlamlı bir açıklama:
This might be a slightly controversial view ( and this is all in my opinion).
   
I have been a Developer for most of my career and I have used an old hierarchical DB, called HP Image 3000, Oracle, MS SQL and MySQL.
IMO, there is a lot of snobbery around Oracle. Its very good, but very expensive and in my opinion largely unnecessary and over used.
When you consider how many large companies and applications use MySQL without any issue, it will cope with 90% of demand. Hardware is so powerful now and the original concerns about performance are largely negated by the raw power of the hardware. Oracle should be a niche market and not a large player, as it really isn’t needed.
I worked for a large American company who used Oracle, I asked why, they said because its the best, I persisted and said what do you mean, they had no answer.
MySQL will be fine for most things and as its free, why not use that. The advent of cloud computing and the pricing model of many data centers, makes licencing very expensive (virtual CPU’s cores) for both Oracle and MS SQL.
Facebook, Uber and Google, used/use MySQL, so the idea its not scalable, is a bit ridiculous.
What is sad and I really mean it, is that the traditional IT Operations and the DBA role in IT, will slowly disappear, as its not really needed unless in some extreme situations.
-- Diğer açıklama:

Oracle is a Database tool that uses PL/SQL language.
MySQL is a also a Database tool itself that uses SQL language.

What is PL/SQL?
Pl-sql nedir plsql nedir pl/sql nedir
PL/SQL is an extension of Structured Query Language (SQL) that is used in Oracle. Unlike SQL, PL/SQL allows the programmer to write code in a procedural format. Full form of PL/SQL is "Procedural Language extensions to SQL".
It combines the data manipulation power of SQL with the processing power of procedural language to create super powerful SQL queries.
PL/SQL means instructing the compiler 'what to do' through SQL and 'how to do' through its procedural way.
Similar to other database languages, it gives more control to the programmers by the use of loops, conditions and object-oriented concepts.

SQL 	 (GITHUB)    (read -ama tekrar)
SQL nedir
In 1970's the product called 'SEQUEL', structured English query language, developed by IBM and later SEQUEL was renamed to 'SQL' which stands for Structured Query Language.
In 1986, SQL was approved by ANSI (American national Standards Institute) and in 1987, it was approved by ISO (International Standards Organization).
SQL is a structure query language which is a common database language for all RDBMS products. Different RDBMS product vendors have developed their own database language by extending SQL for their own RDBMS products.
T-SQL stands for Transact Structure Query Language which is a Microsoft product and is an extension of SQL Language. Example:
MS SQL Server --> SQL\T-SQL
ORACLE        --> SQL\PL-SQL

NoSQL	(GITHUB)
Nosql nedir
https://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/06/top-nosql-database-engines.html
İlişkisiz veritabanıdır. NoSQL is not a relational database.
Bir NoSQL veritabanında, kayıtlar genellikle bir JSON belgesi olarak saklanır.
Why NoSQL? It's high performance with high availability, and offers rich query language and easy scalability.

NoSQL (ilişkisel olmayan) Veritabanları Nasıl Çalışır?
NoSQL veritabanları, verilere erişmek ve verileri yönetmek için belge, grafik, anahtar-değer, bellek içi ve arama dahil olmak üzere çeşitli veri modelleri kullanır. Bu tür veritabanları, özellikle büyük veri hacmi, düşük gecikme süresi ve esnek veri modelleri gerektiren uygulamalar için optimize edilmiştir. Bu gereksinimler, diğer veritabanlarının veri tutarlılığı kısıtlamalarının bir kısmı esnetilerek karşılanır.
NoSQL is a whole new way of thinking about a database. NoSQL is not a relational database. The reality is that a relational database model may not be the best solution for all situations. The easiest way to think of NoSQL, is that of a database which does not adhering to the traditional relational database management system (RDMS) structure. Sometimes you will also see it revered to as 'not only SQL'.

Imagine that you have coupons that you wanted to push to mobile customers that purchase a specific item. This is a customer facing system of engagement requires location data, purchase data, wallet data, and so on. You want to engage the mobile customer in real-time.

What you require is a very agile delivery system that is easily able to processes unstructured data. The system of engagement would need to be extremely dynamic. 

Basit bir kitap veritabanının şemasını modelleme örneğini ele alalım:
•	İlişkisel bir veritabanında genellikle bir kitap kaydı gizlenerek (veya “normalleştirilerek”) ayrı tablolarda depolanırken, ilişkiler birincil ve yabancı anahtar kısıtlamaları tarafından tanımlanır. Bu örnekte Books (Kitaplar) tablosu ISBN, Book Title (Kitap Başlığı) ve Edition Number (Baskı Sayısı) sütunlarına; Authors (Yazarlar) tablosu AuthorID (Yazar Kimliği) ve Author Name (Yazar Adı) sütunlarına; Author-ISBN (Yazar-ISBN) tablosu ise AuthorID (Yazar Kimliği) ve ISBN sütunlarına sahiptir. İlişkisel model, veritabanının yedekliliği azaltacak şekilde normalleştirilmiş ve genel olarak depolama için optimize edilmiş tablolar arasında başvurusal bütünlük uygulamasına imkan tanıyacak şekilde tasarlanmıştır.
•	Bir NoSQL veritabanında, kitap kaydı genellikle bir JSON belgesi olarak saklanır. Her kitap için öğe, ISBN, Book Title (Kitap Başlığı), Edition Number (Baskı Sayısı), Author Name (Yazar Adı) ve AuthorID (Yazar Kimliği) bilgileri tek bir belgede öznitelikler olarak depolanır. Bu modelde, veriler sezgisel yazılım geliştirme ve yatay ölçeklenebilirlik için optimize edilir.

Neden NoSQL veritabanı kullanmalısınız?
NoSQL veritabanları, harika kullanıcı deneyimleri sunulması amacıyla esnek, ölçeklenebilir, yüksek performanslı ve yüksek oranda işlevsel veritabanları gerektiren mobil, web ve oyun gibi birçok modern uygulama için idealdir.
•	Esneklik: NoSQL genellikle daha hızlı ve daha fazla yinelemeli yazılım geliştirmeyi mümkün kılan esnek şemalar sağlar. Esnek veri modeli sayesinde NoSQL veritabanları yarı yapılandırılmış ve yapılandırılmamış veriler için idealdir.
•	Ölçeklenebilirlik: NoSQL veritabanları genellikle pahalı ve kalıcı sunucular eklenerek ölçeği artırılabilecek şekilde değil, dağıtılmış donanım kümeleri kullanılarak ölçeği genişletilebilecek şekilde tasarlanır. Bazı bulut sağlayıcıları bu işlemleri arka planda, tam olarak yönetilen bir hizmet olarak gerçekleştirir.
•	Yüksek performans: NoSQL veritabanları, benzer işlevlerin ilişkisel veritabanlarıyla gerçekleştirilmesi ile karşılaştırıldığında daha yüksek performansı mümkün kılan belirli veri modelleri (belge, anahtar-değer, grafik gibi) ve erişim desenleri için optimize edilmiştir.
•	Yüksek oranda işlevsel: NoSQL veritabanları, her biri ilgili veri modeli için özel olarak tasarlanmış yüksek oranda işlevsel API'ler ve veri türleri sağlar.

Redis (Remote Dictionary Server)	   (GITHUB)
Redis nedir
Redis, bir milisaniyenin altında yanıt süreleri sunan, açık kaynak kodlu bir bellek içi veri deposudur. 
Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes with radius queries and streams. Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.

Redis (/ˈrɛdɪs/; Remote Dictionary Server) is an in-memory data structure project implementing a distributed, in-memory key-value database with optional durability. Redis supports different kinds of abstract data structures, such as strings, lists, maps, sets, sorted sets, HyperLogLogs, bitmaps, streams, and spatial indexes. The project is mainly developed by Salvatore Sanfilippo and as of 2019, is sponsored by Redis Labs.[8] It is open-source software released under a BSD 3-clause license.

History
The name Redis means REmote DIctionary Server.[6] The Redis project began when Salvatore Sanfilippo, nicknamed antirez, the original developer of Redis, was trying to improve the scalability of his Italian startup, developing a real-time web log analyzer. After encountering significant problems in scaling some types of workloads using traditional database systems, Sanfilippo began to prototype a first proof of concept version of Redis in Tcl.[9] Later Sanfilippo translated that prototype to the C language and implemented the first data type, the list. After a few weeks of using the project internally with success, Sanfilippo decided to open source it, announcing the project on Hacker News. The project began to get traction, more so among the Ruby community, with GitHub and Instagram being among the first companies adopting it.

Difference between scaling horizontally and vertically for databases		(GITHUB)

Horizontal scaling nedir, vertical scaling nedir

Horizontal scaling means that you scale by adding more machines into your pool of resources whereas Vertical scaling means that you scale by adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine.
An easy way to remember this is to think of a machine on a server rack, we add more machines across the horizontal direction and add more resources to a machine in the vertical direction.
                   
In a database world horizontal-scaling is often based on the partitioning of the data i.e. each node contains only part of the data, in vertical-scaling the data resides on a single node and scaling is done through multi-core i.e. spreading the load between the CPU and RAM resources of that machine.
With horizontal-scaling it is often easier to scale dynamically by adding more machines into the existing pool - Vertical-scaling is often limited to the capacity of a single machine, scaling beyond that capacity often involves downtime and comes with an upper limit.
Good examples of horizontal scaling are Cassandra, MongoDB, Google Cloud Spanner .. and a good example of vertical scaling is MySQL - Amazon RDS (The cloud version of MySQL). It provides an easy way to scale vertically by switching from small to bigger machines. This process often involves downtime.
In-Memory Data Grids such as GigaSpaces XAP, Coherence etc.. are often optimized for both horizontal and vertical scaling simply because they're not bound to disk. Horizontal-scaling through partitioning and vertical-scaling through multi-core support.

Distributed database / DDBMS
Distributed database nedir? DDBMS nedir (distributed database management system)
A distributed database is a database that consists of two or more files located in different sites either on the same network or on entirely different networks. Portions of the database are stored in multiple physical locations and processing is distributed among multiple database nodes.
Önemli notlar: 
Distributed databases are capable of modular development, meaning that systems can be expanded by adding new computers and local data to the new site and connecting them to the distributed system without interruption.
When failures occur in centralized databases, the system comes to a complete stop. When a component fails in distributed database systems, however, the system will continue to function at reduced performance until the error is fixed.
Admins can achieve lower communication costs for distributed database systems if the data is located close to where it is used the most. This is not possible in centralized systems.
-not bitiş
Kısa açıklama:
A distributed database is a database in which not all storage devices are attached to a common processor.[1] It may be stored in multiple computers, located in the same physical location; or may be dispersed over a network of interconnected computers. Unlike parallel systems, in which the processors are tightly coupled and constitute a single database system, a distributed database system consists of loosely coupled sites that share no physical components.

A centralized distributed database management system (DDBMS) integrates data logically so it can be managed as if it were all stored in the same location. The DDBMS synchronizes all the data periodically and ensures that data updates and deletes performed at one location will be automatically reflected in the data stored elsewhere.
By contrast, a centralized database consists of a single database file located at one site using a single network.
When in a collection, distributed databases are logically interrelated with each other, and they often represent a single logical database. With distributed databases, data is physically stored across multiple sites and independently managed. The processors on each site are connected by a network, and they don't have any multiprocessing configuration.
A common misconception is that a distributed database is a loosely connected file system. In reality, it's much more complicated than that. Distributed databases incorporate transaction processing, but are not synonymous with transaction processing systems.
In general, distributed databases include the following features:
•	Location independent
•	Distributed query processing
•	Distributed transaction management
•	Hardware independent
•	Operating system independent
•	Network independent
•	Transaction transparency
•	DBMS independent
Distributed database architecture
(homogenous distributed database system nedir, heterogeneous distributed database nedir)
Distributed databases can be homogenous or heterogeneous.
In a homogenous distributed database system, all the physical locations have the same underlying hardware and run the same operating systems and database applications. Homogenous distributed database systems appear to the user as a single system, and they can be much easier to design and manage. For a distributed database system to be homogenous, the data structures at each location must be either identical or compatible. The database application used at each location must also be either identical or compatible.

Features of a distributed database
In a heterogeneous distributed database, the hardware, operating systems or database applications may be different at each location. Different sites may use different schemas and software, although a difference in schema can make query and transaction processing difficult.
Different nodes may have different hardware, software and data structure, or they may be in locations that are not compatible. Users at one location may be able to read data at another location but not upload or alter it. Heterogeneous distributed databases are often difficult to use, making them economically infeasible for many businesses.
Types of distributed databases
Replicated data is used to create instances of data in different parts of the database. By using replicated data, distributed databases can access identical data locally, thus avoiding traffic. Replicated data can be divided into two categories: read-only and writable data.
Read-only versions of replicated data allow revisions only to the first instance; subsequent enterprise data replications are then adjusted. Writable data can be altered, but the first instance is immediately changed.
Horizontally fragmented data involves the use of primary keys that refer to one record in the database. Horizontal fragmentation is usually reserved for situations in which business locations only need to access the database pertaining to their specific branch.
Vertically fragmented data involves using copies of primary keys that are available within each section of the database and are accessible to each branch. Vertically fragmented data is utilized when the branch of a business and the central location interact with the same accounts in different ways.

F10 vs F11	(GITHUB)
Yeni başlayanlar için güzel bir not
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15584132/what-is-the-difference-between-f10-and-f11-keys-in-visual-studio/39843982
F10 ("step over") does not descend any further into the call stack. It moves to the next line of the current function.
F11 ("step into") drills down into the function being called.
void function1()
{
    function2();
    function3();

Database Management System - DBMS
Dbms nedir
DBMS: The software which is used to manage database is called Database Management System (DBMS). For Example, MySQL, Oracle etc. are popular commercial DBMS used in different applications. DBMS allows users the following tasks:
Data Definition: It helps in creation, modification and removal of definitions that define the organization of data in database.
Data Updation: It helps in insertion, modification and deletion of the actual data in the database.
Data Retrieval: It helps in retrieval of data from the database which can be used by applications for various purposes.
User Administration: It helps in registering and monitoring users, enforcing data security, monitoring performance, maintaining data integrity, dealing with concurrency control and recovering information corrupted by unexpected failure.
Introduction of DBMS (Database Management System) | Set 1
Important Terminology

Database: Database is a collection of inter-related data which helps in efficient retrieval, insertion and deletion of data from database and organizes the data in the form of tables, views, schemas, reports etc. For Example, university database organizes the data about students, faculty, and admin staff etc. which helps in efficient retrieval, insertion and deletion of data from it.

DDL is short name of Data Definition Language, which deals with database schemas and descriptions, of how the data should reside in the database.

CREATE: to create a database and its objects like (table, index, views, store procedure, function, and triggers)
ALTER: alters the structure of the existing database
DROP: delete objects from the database
(truncate nedir)
TRUNCATE: remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed
COMMENT: add comments to the data dictionary
RENAME: rename an object
DML is short name of Data Manipulation Language which deals with data manipulation and includes most common SQL statements such SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc., and it is used to store, modify, retrieve, delete and update data in a database.

SELECT: retrieve data from a database
INSERT: insert data into a table
UPDATE: updates existing data within a table
DELETE: Delete all records from a database table
MERGE: UPSERT operation (insert or update)
CALL: call a PL/SQL or Java subprogram
EXPLAIN PLAN: interpretation of the data access path
LOCK TABLE: concurrency Control
Database Management System: The software which is used to manage database is called Database Management System (DBMS). For Example, MySQL, Oracle etc. are popular commercial DBMS used in different applications. DBMS allows users the following tasks:

Data Definition: It helps in creation, modification and removal of definitions that define the organization of data in database.

Data Updation: It helps in insertion, modification and deletion of the actual data in the database.

Data Retrieval: It helps in retrieval of data from the database which can be used by applications for various purposes.

User Administration: It helps in registering and monitoring users, enforcing data security, monitoring performance, maintaining data integrity, dealing with concurrency control and recovering information corrupted by unexpected failure.

Paradigm Shift from File System to DBMS

 File System manages data using files in hard disk. Users are allowed to create, delete, and update the files according to their requirement. Let us consider the example of file based University Management System. Data of students is available to their respective Departments, Academics Section, Result Section, Accounts Section, Hostel Office etc. Some of the data is common for all sections like Roll No, Name, Father Name, Address and Phone number of students but some data is available to a particular section only like Hostel allotment number which is a part of hostel office. Let us discuss the issues with this system:

Redundancy of data: Data is said to be redundant if same data is copied at many places. If a student wants to change Phone number, he has to get it updated at various sections. Similarly, old records must be deleted from all sections representing that student.
Inconsistency of Data: Data is said to be inconsistent if multiple copies of same data does not match with each other. If Phone number is different in Accounts Section and Academics Section, it will be inconsistent. Inconsistency may be because of typing errors or not updating all copies of same data.
Difficult Data Access: A user should know the exact location of file to access data, so the process is very cumbersome and tedious. If user wants to search student hostel allotment number of a student from 10000 unsorted students’ records, how difficult it can be.
Unauthorized Access: File System may lead to unauthorized access to data. If a student gets access to file having his marks, he can change it in unauthorized way.
No Concurrent Access: The access of same data by multiple users at same time is known as concurrency. File system does not allow concurrency as data can be accessed by only one user at a time.
No Backup and Recovery: File system does not incorporate any backup and recovery of data if a file is lost or corrupted.
These are the main reasons which made a shift from file system to DBMS.

Access Modifier = Access Specifier = Erişim Modifiyeri)                               	 (GITHUB)
Access modifier nedir, public nedir, private nedir, protected nedir, internal nedir, access specifier nedir, access modifier nedir
Access specifier de denir, access modifier de denir. Kaynaklar incelendi: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/What-are-the-different-access-specifiers-in-Chash-NET
All types and type members have an accessibility level, which controls whether they can be used from other code in your assembly or other assemblies. You can use the following access modifiers to specify the accessibility of a type or member when you declare it:
public

The type or member can be accessed by any other code in the same assembly or another assembly that references it.
private

The type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class or struct.
protected

The type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class, or in a class that is derived from that class. (class dışından erişemezsin)

internal

The type or member can be accessed by any code in the same assembly, but not from another assembly.
protected internal 

The type or member can be accessed by any code in the assembly in which it is declared, or from within a derived class in another assembly.
private protected 

The type or member can be accessed only within its declaring assembly, by code in the same class or in a type that is derived from that class.
The following examples demonstrate how to specify access modifiers on a type and member:
public class Bicycle
{
    public void Pedal() { }
}
Not all access modifiers can be used by all types or members in all contexts, and in some cases the accessibility of a type member is constrained by the accessibility of its containing type. The following sections provide more details about accessibility.
Class and Struct Accessibility
Classes and structs that are declared directly within a namespace (in other words, that are not nested within other classes or structs) can be either public or internal. Internal is the default if no access modifier is specified.
Struct members, including nested classes and structs, can be declared as public, internal, or private. Class members, including nested classes and structs, can be public, protected internal, protected, internal, private protected or private. The access level for class members and struct members, including nested classes and structs, is private by default. Private nested types are not accessible from outside the containing type.
Derived classes cannot have greater accessibility than their base types. In other words, you cannot have a public class B that derives from an internal class A. If this were allowed, it would have the effect of making A public, because all protected or internal members of A are accessible from the derived class.
You can enable specific other assemblies to access your internal types by using the InternalsVisibleToAttribute. For more information, see Friend Assemblies.

Nested Classes
Nested class nedir, nested classes nedir
When one class is entirely dependent upon another, you may decide to implement it using a nested class. Nested classes are declared within the scope of an existing class and receive special benefits when they access their parent class's members.


What are Nested Classes?
A nested class is a special type of class that can be created using C#. Normally classes are declared within a namespace, or in the default namespace if one is not specified. A nested class is defined within the code block of another class, which itself may be a nested class to permit multiple nesting levels.


A nested class generally behaves is the same way as any other class. It can be instantiated separately to its parent class and is not instantiated automatically by its parent. However, there are some important differences. One key difference concerns the scope of the class. Normally classes can be either public or internal. A nested class may be declared as private, meaning that the class can only be seen by its parent class and other nested classes within that parent. A nested class may also be declared as protected, allowing it to also be accessed by classes that derive from its parent type. This may be extended to protected internal to allow other classes in the same assembly to access it.

Nested classes are given special access to instances of their parent classes. When an object of a parent class is passed to a method of a nested class, the method is permitted to access the private and protected members of the object. This makes nested classes ideal where a special relationship exists with the parent class that requires access to private members, particularly when the nested class is not required anywhere else and is never used in a standalone capability.

Example Nested Classes
We will start with a simple example of a nested class. In this case, the outer class will describe a sales order in an order-processing system. In this rather contrived design, there is no requirement for an order line to ever be created without an order. Furthermore, there is no need for an order line to be used externally to an order. In this case, it is useful to create an Order class with a nested, private OrderLine class.
NB: The following code uses .NET 3.0 syntax for brevity. For earlier versions of the .NET framework, you will need to expand the property declarations and possibly remove the use of generics.


class Order
{
    private List<OrderLine> _orderLines = new List<OrderLine>();
 
    public void AddOrderLine(string product, int quantity, double price)
    {
        OrderLine line = new OrderLine();
        line.ProductName = product;
        line.Quantity = quantity;
        line.Price = price;
        _orderLines.Add(line);
    }
 
    public double OrderTotal()
    {
        double total = 0;
        foreach (OrderLine line in _orderLines)
        {
            total += line.OrderLineTotal();
        }
        return total;
    }
 
    // Nested class
    private class OrderLine
    {
        public string ProductName { get; set; }
        public int Quantity { get; set; }
        public double Price { get; set; }
 
        public double OrderLineTotal()
        {
            return Price * Quantity;
        }
    }
}
The code above shows the simplified Order and nested OrderLine classes. The Order class has two public members. The first allows an item to be added to a private collection of order lines. The product name, price and quantity are passed to this method, which builds an OrderLine object and adds it to the list. The second method loops through each item in the collection and calculates the total value for the order.
The nested OrderLine class is used to represent order lines. It includes properties for the product name, quantity and price and a single method that calculates the total price for the order line. As the class is marked as private, it is invisible to all classes except its parent and any other nested classes that we may later create within Order. We could change the access modifier for the nested class to protected if we wished it to be visible to classes that inherit from Order.
We can test the order mechanism with the following code. This creates an order with two order lines and outputs the total value to the console:
Order order = new Order();
order.AddOrderLine("Cheese", 5, 1.99);
order.AddOrderLine("Oranges", 12, 0.35);
Console.WriteLine(order.OrderTotal());  // Outputs "14.15"
Increasing Nested Class Visibility
As our ordering system evolves, we may decide that it would be useful to permit other classes access to the nested OrderLine class. We could then modify the AddOrderLine method to accept an OrderLine object rather than its constituent parts. We can do this by changing the access modifier of the nested class to internal, protected internal or public, depending upon the requirements. The following code shows a new version of the code:

class Order
{
    private List<OrderLine> _orderLines = new List<OrderLine>();
 
    public void AddOrderLine(OrderLine line)
    {
        _orderLines.Add(line);
    }
 
    public double OrderTotal()
    {
        double total = 0;
        foreach (OrderLine line in _orderLines)
        {
            total += line.OrderLineTotal();
        }
        return total;
    }
 
    // Nested class
    internal class OrderLine
    {
        public string ProductName { get; set; }
        public int Quantity { get; set; }
        public double Price { get; set; }
 
        public double OrderLineTotal()
        {
            return Price * Quantity;
        }
    }
}


With the new versions of the classes, the code that creates an order will also be different. Rather than passing the product details as separate variables, the calling class will instantiate order lines and pass these to the AddOrderLine method. When instantiating a nested class, the name of the class must be qualified by prefixing it with the parent class's name, as in the following, updated example. Note that the order lines are created as Order.OrderLine objects.

Order order = new Order();
 
Order.OrderLine line1 = new Order.OrderLine(); //vaaay olaya gel

line1.ProductName = "Cheese";
line1.Quantity = 5;
line1.Price = 1.99;
order.AddOrderLine(line1);
 
Order.OrderLine line2 = new Order.OrderLine();
line2.ProductName = "Oranges";
line2.Quantity = 12;
line2.Price = 0.35;
order.AddOrderLine(line2);
 
Console.WriteLine(order.OrderTotal());


Accessing Private Members of the Parent Class
The final example will demonstrate the ability for nested classes to access private members of their parent classes. In this example, we have modified the order to include a discount multiplier. The multiplier is held as a private variable that may have been initialised using a constructor or a property. In this case the value is fixed at 0.85. Every order line value will be multiplied by this amount to give a 15% discount.
To allow the order lines to access the discount multiplier, the OrderLineTotal method has been updated to include a parameter. This parameter accepts an Order object. The method retrieves the private discount multiplier from the Order and includes it in the calculation, rounding the result to two decimal places on a line-by-line basis. If the OrderLine class was not nested within Order, this would not be possible.

class Order
{
    private List<OrderLine> _orderLines = new List<OrderLine>();
    private double DiscountMultiplier = 0.85;
 
    public void AddOrderLine(OrderLine line)
    {
        _orderLines.Add(line);
    }
 
    public double OrderTotal()
    {
        double total = 0;
        foreach (OrderLine line in _orderLines)
        {
            total += line.OrderLineTotal(this);
        }
        return total;
    }
 
    // Nested class
    internal class OrderLine
    {
        public string ProductName { get; set; }
        public int Quantity { get; set; }
        public double Price { get; set; }
 
        public double OrderLineTotal(Order order)
        {
            return Math.Round(Price * Quantity * order.DiscountMultiplier, 2);
        }
    }
}

NB: Although nested classes can access the private members of their parent class, the reverse is not true. Private members of nested classes are invisible to their parent class.

SQL
SQL nedir
In 1970's the product called 'SEQUEL', structured English query language, developed by IBM and later SEQUEL was renamed to 'SQL' which stands for Structured Query Language.
In 1986, SQL was approved by ANSI (American national Standards Institute) and in 1987, it was approved by ISO (International Standards Organization).
SQL is a structure query language which is a common database language for all RDBMS products. Different RDBMS product vendors have developed their own database language by extending SQL for their own RDBMS products.
T-SQL stands for Transact Structure Query Language which is a Microsoft product and is an extension of SQL Language. Example:
MS SQL Server --> SQL\T-SQL
ORACLE        --> SQL\PL-SQL

derive, derivation, inherit, inheritance kelimeleri
Derive nedir, derivation nedir, inherit nedir, inheritance nedir, derive from nedir, inherit from nedir
Kelimelerin nasıl kullanılabileceğiyle ilgili bilgi içerir:
	Derive
A class can be derived from more than one class or interface 
(derive meaning: obtain something from (a specified source)).

Definition - What does Derived Class mean?
A derived class is a class created or derived from another existing class. The existing class from which the derived class is created through the process of inheritance is known as a base class or superclass.

class <derived_class> : <base_class> 
{
}
	Inherit
Definition - What does Inherited Class mean?
An inherited class is called a subclass of its parent class or super class.
class B inherits from class A: 
class B : A {}
(inherit meaning: derive (a quality, characteristic, or predisposition) genetically from one's parents or ancestors.)
Örnek cümle: The child classes inherit methods and properties of the parent class

sealed 
Sealed nedir
Sealed bir access modifier değildir! Evet, bir modifier'dir. Ama access modifier değildir. Çünkü access'i yani erişimi değiştirmez, yani erişimi modifiye etmez.
Peki sealed tanımda ne olarak geçer?
Sealed bir modifier'dir.
Sealed daha genel anlamda bakıldığında bir keyword'dür tabi ki: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/
Sealed'in neden bir access modifier olmadığına dair güzel bir cevap: Cause if you cannot derive from a class it doesn't mean you cannot access it.
When applied to a class, the sealed modifier prevents other classes from inheriting from it. In the following example, class B inherits from class A, but no class can inherit from class B.
class A {}
sealed class B : A {}
Önemli: You can also use the sealed modifier on a method or property that overrides a virtual method or property in a base class. This enables you to allow classes to derive from your class and prevent them from overriding specific virtual methods or properties.
Example (gayet açık)
In the following example, Z inherits from Y but Z cannot override the virtual function F that is declared in X and sealed in Y.
C#Copy
class X
{
    protected virtual void F() { Console.WriteLine("X.F"); }
    protected virtual void F2() { Console.WriteLine("X.F2"); }
}

class Y : X
{
    sealed protected override void F() { Console.WriteLine("Y.F"); }
    protected override void F2() { Console.WriteLine("Y.F2"); }
}

class Z : Y
{
    // Attempting to override F causes compiler error CS0239.
    // protected override void F() { Console.WriteLine("Z.F"); }

    // Overriding F2 is allowed.
    protected override void F2() { Console.WriteLine("Z.F2"); }
}
When you define new methods or properties in a class, you can prevent deriving classes from overriding them by not declaring them as virtual.
It is an error to use the abstract modifier with a sealed class, because an abstract class must be inherited by a class that provides an implementation of the abstract methods or properties.
When applied to a method or property, the sealed modifier must always be used with override.
Because structs are implicitly sealed, they cannot be inherited.
For more information, see Inheritance.
For more examples, see Abstract and Sealed Classes and Class Members.
Example
sealed class SealedClass
{
    public int x;
    public int y;
}

class SealedTest2
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var sc = new SealedClass();
        sc.x = 110;
        sc.y = 150;
        Console.WriteLine($"x = {sc.x}, y = {sc.y}");
    }
}
// Output: x = 110, y = 150
In the previous example, you might try to inherit from the sealed class by using the following statement:
class MyDerivedC: SealedClass{} // Error
The result is an error message:
'MyDerivedC': cannot derive from sealed type 'SealedClass'
Remarks
To determine whether to seal a class, method, or property, you should generally consider the following two points:
•	The potential benefits that deriving classes might gain through the ability to customize your class.
•	The potential that deriving classes could modify your classes in such a way that they would no longer work correctly or as expected.

Dataset
DataSet: This is a collection of DataTables. We use the DataSet type to store many DataTables in a single collection. Conceptually, the DataSet acts as a set of DataTable instances. 
Usage: DataSet simplifies programs that use many DataTables. To effectively use the DataSet, you will need to have some DataTables handy. We begin by creating some. 
Create: In this program, we create two DataTables. One stores two rows of patient information. And the second stores two rows of medication information. 
Next: We create a DataSet with the DataSet constructor. Then we add the two DataTables to the DataSet instance. Finally we print the XML. 
DataSetName: Every DataSet can have a name specified. Usually, it is easiest to specify this inside the DataSet constructor. But you don't always know the name at this time. 
However: You can also change the name by assigning to the DataSetName property. You can also read the DataSetName property. 
Copy, Clear: DataSet has a Clear method that clears all the DataTables in the set. It also provides a Copy method that will make a deep copy of all the DataTables in the set. 
Tip: If you call Copy and the Clear the original, your copied data will still exist unchanged.
	public ActionResult Index()
	{
            // Önce DataSet oluşturuldu
            // Sonra DataTable oluşturuldu (tablo)
            // Sonra oluşturulan tabloya kolonlar eklendi
            // Sonra bu kolonlara örnek veriler eklendi (datarow)
            // Sonra ilk başta oluşturduğumuz Dataset'in içine, DataTable'ımızı yerleştirdik ve View'a yolladık.
 
            DataSet ds = new DataSet();
            DataTable dt = new DataTable("YeniTablo");
 
            dt.Clear();
 
            dt.Columns.Add("Isim");
            dt.Columns.Add("SoyIsim");
 
            DataRow dr = dt.NewRow();
 
            // Row'lar farklı şekilde de eklenebilir. 2. örneğe bakılabilir.
            dr["Isim"] = "Eren";
            dr["SoyIsim"] = "OZTEN";
            dt.Rows.Add(dr);
 
            ds.Tables.Add(dt);
 
            return View(ds);

View:

{
    @(row["Isim"] + " " + row["SoyIsim"])

            dataTable1.Rows.Add("Monte Cristo", 1);
            dataTable1.Rows.Add("Jane Eyre", 2);
 
            DataTable dataTable2 = new DataTable("Medications");
            dataTable2.Columns.Add("Id");
            dataTable2.Columns.Add("Medication");
            dataTable2.Rows.Add(1, "Atenolol");
            dataTable2.Rows.Add(2, "Amoxicillin");
 
            // Oluşturduğumuz dataTable'ları dataSet içine koyalım.
 
            DataSet dataSet = new DataSet("dataSetNam");
            dataSet.Tables.Add(dataTable1);
            dataSet.Tables.Add(dataTable2);

metadata
metadata nedir
Metadata is simply data about data. It means it is a description and context of the data. It helps to organize, find and understand data. Here are a few real world examples of metadata:
Those are some typical metadata elements:
1.	Title and description,
2.	Tags and categories,
3.	Who created and when,
4.	Who last modified and when,
5.	Who can access or update.
Every time you take a photo with today's cameras a bunch of metadata is gathered and saved with it:
•	date and time,
•	filename,
•	camera settings,
•	geolocation.

HTTPGet vs HTTPPost
Httpget nedir httppost nedir
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Un2JTC7tFPI
Videoyu izle…
Get yapınca veriler url ye yazılır. Post ta ise form yollanır… Url ile yollanmaz veri. Message body içinde yollanır.
Get metotlara url'ye yazıp enter yaparak ulaşılır. O yüzden tehlikeli olabilir…
DB'deki değerleri hem Get hem Post ile değiştirebiliriz tabi ki. Ama dediğimiz gibi get ile bunu yapmak tehlikelidir.
-
The GET Method
GET is used to request data from a specified resource. 
GET is one of the most common HTTP methods. 
Note that the query string (name/value pairs) is sent in the URL of a GET request: 
/test/demo_form.php?name1=value1&name2=value2
Some other notes on GET requests: 
GET requests can be cached
GET requests remain in the browser history
GET requests can be bookmarked
GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data
GET requests have length restrictions
GET requests are only used to request data (not modify)
The POST Method
POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource. 
The data sent to the server with POST is stored in the request body of the HTTP request: 
POST /test/demo_form.php HTTP/1.1
Host: w3schools.com
name1=value1&name2=value2
(yukarıda request body'nin neye benzediğini görmüş olduk. Get request'lerde request body yoktur. Veri url'den gönderilir)
Some other notes on POST requests:
POST requests are never cached
POST requests do not remain in the browser history
POST requests cannot be bookmarked
POST requests have no restrictions on data length
-
GET methodu HTTP istekleri arasındaki varsayılan yöntemdir.  GET metodu ile yapılan istekler tarayıcının adres satırında görünür. Sadece belirli boyutta veri gönderileceği zaman kullanılır.
POST metodu ise URL’ de görünmesini istemediğimiz veriler olduğunda kullanılabilir. POST yönteminde gönderebileceğimiz verinin boyutu ile ilgili bir sınır yoktur. Ayrıca gönderdiğimiz parametrelerin adres satırında görünmemesi dolayısıyla GET yöntemine göre daha güvenlidir. HTML form gönderileceği zaman neredeyse her zaman POST yöntemi tercih edilir.
Örnek vermek gerekirse Kisilers tablomuzun olduğu bir proje üzerinde kişi bilgilerini düzenlemek isteyebiliriz. Bunun için genellikle iki Action oluştururuz. Bunlardan biri kişinin ID sini parametre olarak alan gelen ID ye göre kişinin bilgilerini Edit formunda açan Action iken diğeri POST olduğunda yani Kaydet butonuna tıklandığında kullanılacak Actiondur.
 
public ActionResult Edit(int? id)
{
if (id == null)
 
{  return new HttpStatusCodeResult(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest);  }
 
Kisiler kisiler = db.Kisilers.Find(id);
 
if (kisiler == null) 
{
return HttpNotFound();
}
 
return View(kisiler);
}
 
Yukarıda ki Action’ da querystring’imiz kisa iken aşağıdakinde Kisilers tablosundaki kolon sayısına göre uzunluğu değişecek bir querystring söz konusu. Ayrıca buradan dönen bilgilerinde adres çubuğunda görünmesini istemediğimiz için POST methodunu kullanırız.
Önemli:
Browsers can cache GET requests, generally on static data, like images or scripts. But you can also allow browsers to cache GET requests to controller actions as well, using [OutputCache] or other similar ways, so if caching is turned on for a GET controller action, it's possible that clicking on a link leading to /Home/Index doesn't actually run the Index method on the server, but rather allows the browser to serve up the page from its own cache.
With this line of thinking, you can safely turn on caching on GET actions in which the data you're serving up doesn't change (or doesn't change often), with the knowledge that your server action won't fire every time.
POSTs won't be cached by the browser, so any POST is guaranteed to make it to the server.
-
Güzel bir açıklama:
Ignore caching for a moment. Another way of thinking about this is that search engines will store HTTP GET links during their indexing/crawling process, therefore they will show up in search results.
Suppose if your /Home/Index is implemented as GET but it lets say deletes a row in your Database, every time this link shows up on a search engine and somebody clicks it, you will have a delete row, and soon you have a lot deleted rows.

Bundling in MVC / Bundle in MVC 
Bundling  nedir, bundle nedir
Detaylı bilgil için link kesinlikle incelenmeli: https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/mvc/bundling-and-minification-in-asp.net-mvc
Bundle ingilizcede "demet" demektir... Bundling request'lerin daha hızlı gerçekleşmesi için yapılır. (Request load time'ı azaltmak için yapılır). İstenen statik dosyaları farklı farklı http request'lerle yollamaktansa hepsini bir bundle içinde (demette) toplayıp tek bir http request'iyle yollayabiliriz. Dolayısıyla bundling zaman yönünden verimlilik sağlayan bir tekniktir. Aklımıza şunu getirebiliriz: Çiçekleri tek tek vermektense bir demet halinde tek bir hamleyle veriyoruz. Bundling'in faydası sadece bununla sınırlı değildir.
Bundling, script/style dosyalarımızın gereksiz kısımlarını (gereksiz boşluklar vb) siler. Böylelikle dosyayı minimize etmiş olur (yani boyutunu düşürmüş olur). Bu da sunucu üzerine bindirilen yükü azaltır. Örneğin aşağıdaki kod parçacığını;
sayHello = function(name){
    //this is comment
    var msg = "Hello" + name;
    alert(msg);
}

Şu hale getirir:
sayHello=function(n){var t="Hello"+n;alert(t)}

Görüldüğü gibi comment satırını bile silmiş..
Not: Bahsedilen statik dosyalar hem script dosyaları, hem de style dosyaları olabilir. Script dosyalarımızı ScriptBundle kullanarak, style dosyalarımızı da StyleBundle kullanılarak gönderiyoruz.
Bundle'ları nasıl oluşturduğumuz ve View'da nasıl render ettiğimiz yukarıdaki linkte anlatılıyor. 

Script bundle:
https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/mvc/scriptbundle-mvc
bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle("~/bundles/myScriptsBundle").Include(
                "~/Scripts/myScript.js"));
buradaki  ScriptBundle'yi unutma. Bundle ye script koyacaksak; bunun adı ScriptBundle olmalı, yok eğer style dosyaları koyacaksak (CSS) o zaman adı StyleBundle olur.
~/bundles
bu kısmı yazmazsak çalışmıyor.
myScriptsBundle
bizim vereceğimiz özel isim, kafaya göre.
Scripts
bu ise script'in hangi file içinde olduğunu gösteriyor
myScript.js
çalıştırmak istediğimiz script dosyası..
sonra bu bundle'ı RENDER etmemiz gerekiyor. Yoksa çalışmaz. 
Scriptleri layoutta render edelim ki her sayfada geçerli olsun:
    @Scripts.Render("~/bundles/myScriptsBundle")

Not: render ederken diğer jquery vb dosyalarından sonra render et çünkü script'inde kesin jquery falan kullanmışsındır. o yüzden önce JQuery bundle render edilsin, sonra senin scriptin.

Style bundle:
STYLE'LAR BÖYLE YAPILMALI:
     bundles.Add(new StyleBundle("~/bundles/VereceginİsimKafayaGöre").Include(
                "~/Content/site2.css"));
    @Styles.Render("~/bundles/ VereceginİsimKafayaGöre")

Library	   (GITHUB) 		(read)
Library nedir
(Dapper,  Automapper vb birer library'dir, client side validation için kullandığımız  jQuery Unobtrusive Validation Library de bir library'dir)
Yazılım kütüphanesi (Software Library), yazılım geliştiricilerinin program geliştirirken kullandıkları bir tür program kodları ve veriler takımıdır. Yazılım kütüphaneleri, yazılımcılar ve programlama dilinin derleyicilerine çalıştırılabilir programlar geliştirme konusunda yardımcı olurlar. Yazılım kütüphaneleri içinde genellikle önceden hazırlanmış kodlar, sınıflar, prosedürler, betikler, konfigürasyon verilerini içerir.
Bir geliştirici yazılım geliştirirken yazılımını daha işlevsel hale getirmek veya çeşitli fonksiyonlar kazandırmak için yazılım kütüphanelerinden faydalanır. Yazılım kütüphaneleri yazılımcıların iş yükünü hafifletir ve aynı kodu tekrar yazmalarına gerek kalmadan onlara hazır bir kalıp sunar. Basit bir örnekle açıklamamız gerekirse; bir geliştirici matematikle ilgili bir yazılım geliştirdiğinde bu yazılıma karmaşık matematik işlemlerini yaptırması için ayrı ayrı modüller yazmak zorunda kalacaktır. Bu kodları yazmaya uğraşmak yerine yazılım kütüphanesindeki bir matematik modülünü alıp bu modülü doğrudan kendi yazılımına ilave edebilir.
In computer science, a library is a collection of non-volatile resources used by computer programs, often for software development. These may include configuration data, documentation, help data, message templates, pre-written code and subroutines, classes, values or type specifications. In IBM's OS/360 and its successors they are referred to as partitioned data sets.
A library is also a collection of implementations of behavior, written in terms of a language, that has a well-defined interface by which the behavior is invoked. For instance, people who want to write a higher level program can use a library to make system calls instead of implementing those system calls over and over again. In addition, the behavior is provided for reuse by multiple independent programs. A program invokes the library-provided behavior via a mechanism of the language. For example, in a simple imperative language such as C, the behavior in a library is invoked by using C's normal function-call. What distinguishes the call as being to a library function, versus being to another function in the same program, is the way that the code is organized in the system.
Library code is organized in such a way that it can be used by multiple programs that have no connection to each other, while code that is part of a program is organized to be used only within that one program. 
The value of a library lies in the reuse of the behavior. When a program invokes a library, it gains the behavior implemented inside that library without having to implement that behavior itself. Libraries encourage the sharing of code in a modular fashion, and ease the distribution of the code.
The behavior implemented by a library can be connected to the invoking program at different program lifecycle phases. If the code of the library is accessed during the build of the invoking program, then the library is called a static library.[1] An alternative is to build the executable of the invoking program and distribute that, independently of the library implementation. The library behavior is connected after the executable has been invoked to be executed, either as part of the process of starting the execution, or in the middle of execution. In this case the library is called a dynamic library (loaded at runtime). A dynamic library can be loaded and linked when preparing a program for execution, by the linker. Alternatively, in the middle of execution, an application may explicitly request that a module be loaded.
Most compiled languages have a standard library although programmers can also create their own custom libraries. Most modern software systems provide libraries that implement the majority of the system services. Such libraries have commoditized the services which a modern application requires. As such, most code used by modern applications is provided in these system libraries.

Framework	   (GITHUB)
framework nedir
Önceden hazırlanmış belirli standartlar halinde kütüphanelerin bulunduğu bir iskelettir. İhtiyaca göre projemizi o iskelete dahil edip inşa ederiz.
Framework, yazılım geliştiricilerin kullandığı önceden hazırlanmış kütüphanelerin bunluduğu ve bunlara yenilerini ekleyebileceği yapıların adıdır. Gelişmiş frameworklerde form kontrolü, veri tabanı bağlantısı, kullanıcı giriş çıkış, mail atma, tema motoru gibi kütüphaneler mevcuttur.
Frameworkler ayrıca MVC (Model, View, Controller) gibi bölümlerden oluşarak projenizin daha okunabilir düzenlenebilir olmasını sağlamaktadır.
Yapılan projelerin çoğunda aradan belirli bir zaman geçtikten sonra düzenlemek zorlaşır. Hem kodların artması hem de yazılan kodun unutulması revize sürecini uzatmakta. Bu yapılar Modelde veritabanı işlemlerini, Controllerda genel mekaniği, Viewda ise görünüm kodu içerdiği için müdahale edilmesi gereken yer tam olarak bulanabilmektedir. 

A framework, or software framework, is a platform for developing software applications. It provides a foundation on which software developers can build programs for a specific platform. For example, a framework may include predefined classes and functions that can be used to process input, manage hardware devices, and interact with system software. This streamlines the development process since programmers don't need to reinvent the wheel each time they develop a new application.
A framework is similar to an application programming interface (API), though technically a framework includes an API. As the name suggests, a framework serves as a foundation for programming, while an API provides access to the elements supported by the framework. A framework may also include code libraries, a compiler, and other programs used in the software development process.
Several different types of software frameworks exist. Popular examples include ActiveX and .NET for Windows development, Cocoa for Mac OS X, Cocoa Touch for iOS, and the Android Application Framework for Android. Software development kits (SDKs) are available for each of these frameworks and include programming tools designed specifically for the corresponding framework. For example, Apple's Xcode development software includes a Mac OS X SDK designed for writing and compiling applications for the Cocoa framework.

Ad Hoc Query
Ad hoc nedir, ad hoc query nedir, ad-hoc query nedir
Definition - What does Ad Hoc Query mean?
In SQL, an ad hoc query is a loosely typed command/query whose value depends upon some variable. Each time the command is executed, the result is different, depending on the value of the variable. It cannot be predetermined and usually comes under dynamic programming SQL query. An ad hoc query is short lived and is created at runtime.
Techopedia explains Ad Hoc Query
As the word "ad hoc" suggests, this type of query is designed for a "particular purpose,"which is in contrast to a predefined query, which has the same output value on every execution. An ad hoc query does not reside in the system for a long time and is created dynamically on demand by the user. It is more efficient to use an ad hoc query in programming as it saves system resources, but, at the same time complex, ad hoc queries (have multiple variables) also challenge the processing speed and runtime memory of the system.

.NET Framework    (GITHUB)
.NET nedir?
.NET Framework (pronounced as "dot net") is a software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows. It includes a large class library named as Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language interoperability (each language can use code written in other languages) across several programming languages. Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment (in contrast to a hardware environment) named the Common Language Runtime (CLR). The CLR is an application virtual machine that provides services such as security, memory management, and exception handling. As such, computer code written using .NET Framework is called "managed code". FCL and CLR together constitute the .NET Framework.

The .NET platform
.NET is a developer platform made up of tools, programming languages, and libraries for building many different types of applications.
The base platform provides components that apply to all different types of apps. Additional frameworks, such as ASP.NET, extend .NET with components for building specific types of apps.
Here are some things included in the .NET platform:
•	The C# programming language and its compilers
•	Base libraries for working with strings, dates, files/IO, and more
•	Editors and tools for Windows, Linux, macOS, and Docker

UI (User Interface)   (GITHUB)
The user interface (UI) is the point of human-computer interaction and communication in a device. This can include display screens, keyboards, a mouse and the appearance of a desktop. It is also the way through which a user interacts with an application or a website. The growing dependence of many businesses on web applications and mobile applications has led many companies to place increased priority on UI in an effort to improve the user's overall experience.
Types of user interfaces
The various types of user interfaces include:
•	graphical user interface (GUI)
•	command line interface (CLI)
•	menu-driven user interface
•	touch user interface
•	voice user interface (VUI)
•	form-based user interface
•	natural language user interface
Examples of user interfaces
Some examples of user interfaces include:
•	computer mouse
•	remote control
•	virtual reality
•	ATMs
•	speedometer
•	the old iPod click wheel
Websites such as Airbnb, Dropbox and Virgin America display strong user interface design. Sites like these have created pleasant, easily operable, user-centered designs (UCD) that focus on the user and their needs.

In early computers, there was very little user interface except for a few buttons at an operator's console. Many of these early computers used punched cards, prepared using keypunch machines, as the primary method of input for computer programs and data. While punched cards have been essentially obsolete in computing since 2012, some voting machines still use a punched card system.
The user interface evolved with the introduction of the command line interface, which first appeared as a nearly blank display screen with a line for user input. Users relied on a keyboard and a set of commands to navigate exchanges of information with the computer. This command line interface led to one in which menus (lists of choices written in text) predominated.
Finally, the GUI arrived, originating mainly in Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), adopted and enhanced by Apple and effectively standardized by Microsoft in its Windows operating systems. Elements of a GUI include such things as windows, pull-down menus, buttons, scroll bars and icons. With the increasing use of multimedia as part of the GUI, sound, voice, motion video and virtual reality are increasingly becoming the GUI for many applications.

UI ve UX çoğu kez beraber kullanılmalarına rağmen aslında çok farklı iki alandır. UI konusunda olmasa bile UX konusunda çok geride olan ülkemizde, maalesef bu işi profesyonel olarak yapan insanlar bile aralarındaki farkı çok bilmiyorlar. Ülkemizde bir UXD (User Interface Designer) ile tanışmanız çok zor. Türkiye’de bu işle ilgili çoğu insanın özgeçmişinde “UI/UX” yazar. Bunun bir sebebi aralarındaki farkın bilinmemesi, diğer sebebi ise internet sektörünü geriden takip etmemizden dolayı bu işi iki parçaya bölmenin bir lüks olarak görünmesidir.

Kısaca bahsetmek gerekirse; UI, aslında arayüz tasarımıdır. Televizyon kumandasının üstündeki tuşlar, bir arayüz tasarımı örneğidir. Tuşların yerleri, büyüklüğü, renkleri tasarımcının verdiği kararlar sonucu uygulanır. Arayüz tasarımının internet sitelerindeki karşılığı ise butonlar, grid yapısı, mizanpaj, renkler, boşluklar gibi tüm grafik elemanlardan oluşan görsel tasarımdır. Zamanla internet sitelerindeki interaksiyon arttıkça, önceleri çok da önemsenmeyen arayüz tasarımı da gittikçe önemli bir hal aldı. Kullanıcıların sitede rahatça dolaşmaları ve hatta kalmalarını sağlamak için basit ve kullanılabilir bir arayüz artık şart. Kullanıcılar bir sitede dolaşmaya veya terk etmeye saniyeler içerisinde karar veriyorlar. Yoğun uğraşlarla sitenize yönlendirdiğiniz kullanıcıları sitenizde tutamadığınız zaman da maalesef tüm uğraşlarınız boşa gidiyor.
The emerging popularity of mobile applications has also affected UI, leading to something called mobile UI. Mobile UI is specifically concerned with creating usable, interactive interfaces on the smaller screens of smartphones and tablets and improving special features, like touch controls.

Initialization	 	(GITHUB)

This is when values are put into the memory that was allocated. This is what the Constructor of a class does when using the new keyword.

A variable must also be initialized by having the reference to some object in memory passed to it.
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
Aşağıda örnekli olarak bu üçlünün tanımı yapılmış

Declaration - Declaring a variable means to introduce a new variable to the program. You define its type and its name.

int a; //a is declared
Instantiate - Instantiating a class means to create a new instance of the class.
MyObject x = new MyObject(); //we are making a new instance of the class MyObject
Açıklama 2:
Instantiate literally means "to create an instance of". In programming, this generally means to create an instance of an object (generally on "the heap"). This is done via the new keyword in most languages. ie: new object();. Most of the time you will also save a reference to the object. ie: object myObject = new object();.


Initialize - To initialize a variable means to assign it an initial value.
Açıklama 2: 
Initialize means to give an initial value to. In some languages, if you don't initialize a variable it will have arbitrary (dirty/garbage) data in it. In C# it is actually a compile-time error to read from an uninitialized variable.

int a; //a is declared
int a = 0; //a is declared AND initialized to 0
MyObject x = new MyObject(); //x is declared and initialized with an instance of MyObject
Assigning - Assigning to a variable means to provide the variable with a value.

int a = 0; //we are assigning to a; yes, initializing a variable means you assign it a value, so they do overlap!
a = 1; //we are assigning to a

Assigning:
Assigning is simply the storing of one value to a variable. x = 5 assigns the value 5 to the variable  x. In some languages, assignment cannot be combined with declaration, but in C# it can be: int x = 5;.

Note that the statement object myObject = new object(); combines all four of these.

new object() instantiates a new object object, returning a reference to it.
object myObject declares a new object reference.
= initializes the reference variable by assigning the value of the reference to it.

SOLID Principles 	(GITHUB)
SOLID Principles nedir, solid nedir, SOLID nedir, single responsibility nedir, srp nedir, open closed nedir, open-closed nedir, open/closed nedir, open-closed principle nedir, open/closed principle nedir

S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Bir programdaki her class veya modül sadece tek bir görevi yerine getirmelidir, birden fazla görev bir class'a veya modüle atanmamalıdır. SRP bununla da sınırlı değildir olay. Yapılan bu tek görev, ilgili class tarafından enkapsüle edilmelidir, yani yapılan görev, işlemle ilgisi olmayan diğer class'lardan gizlenmelidir.
The single responsibility principle (SRP) states that every class or module in a program should have responsibility for just a single piece of that program's functionality. Further, the elements of that responsibility should be encapsulated by the responsible class rather than spread out in unrelated classes.
O: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Nesne genişlemeye (extension'a) açık, değişikliklere kapalı olmalıdır (modification).

L: Liskov ‘s Substitution Principle (LSP) 
Alt sınıflar, üst sınıflar ile yer değiştirdiğinde herhangi bir problem ortaya çıkmamalıdır, alt sınıf üst sınıf yerine kullanılabilmelidir. Gökhan gökalp açıklaması: Alt sınıftan türetilmiş nesneler, üst sınıftan türetilen nesnelerle yer değiştirdiklerinde yine aynı davranışı -herhangi bir problem çıkmadan- sergilemesi gerektiğini savunur.
“Aynı temel sınıftan türeyen tüm sınıflar, birbirlerinin yerine kullanılabilir olmalıdır. Bu yer değiştirme durumunda, sınıfa özel bir istisna kesinlikle oluşmamalıdır.”
I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Bir client, kullanmadığı metoda bağlı olmamalıdır. Bu, büyük bir interface'in küçük parçalara ayrılmasıyla ve bu yeni küçük interface'lerin implement edilmesiyle gerçekleştirilir.
D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
Üst sınıflar, alt sınıflara bağlı olmamalıdır. Hem üst, hem alt sınıflar abstraction'lara bağlı olmalıdır.

Yazılıma yeni başlayan hemen herkesin zaman zaman karıştırdığı, hangisini ne zaman kullanacağına karar veremediği Abstract Class ve Interface ikilisini ele almak istedim. İlk bakışta yazdığımız koda oldukça benzer yetenekler kazandırdıkları görünse de aralarındaki farkların üzerinde durarak hangi senaryolarda hangisine karar vermemiz gerektiğini iyice açığa çıkartacağız 🙂
 
 
© agile-code.com
Abstract sınıflara geçmeden önce C# ve tüm Object Oriented dillerin bize sunduğu bir özellik olan abstraction(soyutlama) kavramını ele alalım. Böylece Abstract sınıflara ve Interface’lere neden ihtiyaç duyduğumuzu daha net bir şekilde anlayabiliriz.
Abstraction (Soyutlama) Nedir?
Abstraction, OOP (Object Oriented Programming-Nesne Tabanlı Programlama) içerisindeki önemli kavramlardan birisidir. C#’taki soyutlama; diğer Object Oriented dillerde olduğu gibi iç detayları gizleyerek sadece işlevleri göstermeye denir. Bu durumu gerçek hayatın içerisinden bir senaryo ile örneklendirelim.
Senaryo: Bir gün canınız sıkıldı ve çocukluğunuzda kalmış tatlı bir aktivite olan lunaparka gidip çarpışan arabaya binmek istediniz. Biletinizi aldınız ve seçtiğiniz arabaya oturup size gelen görevliye bileti teslim ettiniz. Görevli alana baktı ve araçları hareket ettirecek olan elektriği vermek için yeterli sayıda kişinin olduğuna karar verip bir düğmeye bastı. Görevlinin düğmeye basmasıyla çarpışan arabaların hareket etmesi için gerekli olan elektrik akımı verildi ve arabanız çalışır hale geldi. Direksiyonu, gaz pedalını ve freni kullanarak dilediğiniz şekilde aracı kullanmaya başladınız.
Şimdi gelin bu gerçek hayatın birebir içinden olan senaryodaki soyutlamaları (abstractions) inceleyelim. Böylece yazılım alanında da aslında aynı mantığın kullanıldığını ve soyutlamanın hayatımızı nasıl kolaylaştırdığını daha iyi anlamış olacağız.
Senaryoda Yer Alan Soyutlamalar(Abstractions): İlk soyutlama örneğimiz biletinizi teslim ettiğiniz görevlinin eğlenceyi başlatmak için bastığı küçük kırmızı düğme 🙂 Görevli o kırmızı düğmeye bastığında bizler sadece eğlencenin başlayacağını biliyoruz, görevli de on dakikalık bir seansa daha start vereceğini biliyor yalnızca. Düğmeye basıldığı anda elektrik devresindeki anahtarın kapanıp akımın başlayacağını ne biz ne de görevli aklının ucundan dahi geçirmiyor. İşte bu tam bir soyutlama örneği. Yalnızca input(düğmeye basmak) ve output(eğlencenin başlaması) değerleriyle ilgileniyoruz. Arka tarafta dönen teknik hadiseleri hiç düşünmeden bize sunulmuş bir düğmeyi kullanarak işimizi görüyoruz.
Eğer hala bir şeyler oturmadıysa kafanızda bir de çarpışan arabamızdaki soyutlamaya bakalım. Siz arabayı kullanırken direksiyonu gitmek istediğiniz yöne çeviriyor, gaz pedalına basarak ilerliyorsunuz. Gaz pedalına bastığınızdaki motorda oluşan tetiklenmeleri, direksiyonu çevirdiğinizde lastiklerin dönmesini sağlayan mekanizmayı hiç düşünmeden yalnızca iki pedal bir direksiyonla aslında arka planında onlarca aksiyon yatan bir işlevi gerçekleştirmiş oluyorsunuz. Input (gaz/fren pedalları, direksiyon) ve output (arabanın gitmesi) değerlerini bilmek size yetiyor.
Object Oriented programlamada sınıfların soyutlanmasını ise Abstract Class ve Interface ikilisi sağlamaktadır. Abstraction kavramı kafamızda biraz olsun şekillendiğine göre şimdi Abstract Class’ları inceleyebiliriz.
Abstract Class
Abstract sınıflar sınıf hiyerarşisinde genellikle base class (temel sınıf) tanımlamak için kullanılan ve soyutlama yeteneği kazandıran sınıflardır. Bir sınıfı abstract yapmak için abstract keywordünü kullanırız. Abstract sınıflar en az bir tane abstract metod bulundurması bir best practice’tir.

abstract class Yazdir{     public abstract void KonsolaYazdir();}
Yukarıda Yazdir isimli basitçe bir abstract sınıfı tanımladık ve kendisinden türeyecek metodların override edeceği KonsolaYazdir() abstract metodunu oluşturduk.
Genel olarak abstract sınıfların özelliklerini bir araya toplarsak;
•	Abstract sınıfları genel olarak inheritance (kalıtım) uygularken kullanırız.
•	new anahtar sözcüğü ile nesneleri oluşturulamaz.
•	İçerisinde değişken ve metod bulundurabilir.
•	Abstract sınıflardan türetilen sınıfların abstract metodları implement etmesi zorunludur. Diğer metodları override etmeden de kullanabilir.
•	Constructors (yapıcı metodlar) ve destructors (yıkıcı metodlar) bulundurabilirler.
•	Static tanımlanamazlar. ( Tanımlanmaya çalışılırsa compiler “an abstract class cannot be sealed or static” hatası verir)
•	Bir sınıf yalnızca bir abstract sınıfı inheritance yoluyla implement edebilir. Çoklu kalıtım (multiple inheritance) desteklenmez.
•	Abstract olmayan metodları da bulundurabilir.
•	Kendisinden inherit alacak sınıflar ile arasında “is-a” ilişkisi vardır. (Burası ilk başlarda çok önemsenmeyen ancak hangi senaryoda Abstract hangi senaryoda Interface kullanacağımızı netleştirmede bize oldukça yardımcı olan bir detaydır, hemen aşağıda açıklamasını bulabilirsiniz)
Is-a İlişkisi Nedir?
Senaryomuzdan bir örnekle bunun daha iyi anlaşılabileceğini düşünüyorum. (Şimdiye kadar Türkçe kelimeler üzerinden gittiğim için örneğimde de is-a ilişkisi hariç cümlemi Türkçe kuruyorum)

Çarpışan araba is-a araba.
Yani en nihayetinde çarpışan araba da bir arabadır ve arabanın sahip olduğu özellikleri bünyesinde barındırır.
Şimdi Araba için abstract bir sınıf oluşturup çarpışan arabayı da bu sınıftan inherit alarak oluşturalım.

abstract class Araba{    
//Arabalarin ortak ozelliklerini burada tanimliyoruz    
public string Marka { get; set; }    
public int MaksimumHiz { get; set; }    
public string Tur { get; set; }
//Her araba icin yolculuga baslandi bilgisini farkli bir sekilde
//ekrana yazdirmak icin override  dilecek abstract metodumuzu yaziyoruz
public abstract void YolculugaBasla();
}

class CarpisanAraba : Araba{    
//Abstract metodumuzu carpisan arabaya ozel bir sekilde override      ediyoruz.    
public override void YolculugaBasla(){        Console.WriteLine("Carpisan araba ile yolculuga baslandi");    }
}
Araba isminde bir abstract sınıf tanımlayarak CarpisanAraba sınıfını bu abstract base sınıftan türettik. 
Böylece Araba sınıfında yer alan tüm özellikleri tekrardan yazmak zorunda kalmadan kolayca sahip olurken, YolculugaBasla() metodunu sınıfımıza özel override ettik. 
Abstract sınıfları inherit alan sınıfların abstract metodları override etmesinin zorunlu olduğunu belirtmiştik. Bu sebeple Visual Studio’da CarpisanAraba sınıfını Araba sınıfından inherit ettiğinizde, YolculugaBasla() metodunu override etmezseniz hata alırsınız.
Abstract sınıfları genel itibariyle mercek altına aldığımıza göre şimdi bir de Interface’leri inceleyelim. Sonrasında ikisi arasındaki farkları tablo halinde gördüğümüzde hangi senaryoda hangi soyutlama mekanizmasını kullanacağımızı çok daha iyi kestirebilir bir hale geleceğiz.
Interface
Interface, içerisinde sadece kendisinden türeyecek olan sınıfların içini dolduracağı metod tanımlarının bulunduğu ve soyutlama yapmamıza olanak sağlayan bir yapıdır. Interface’leri tanımlarken interface keyword'ünü kullanırız. Tanımladığımız yapının interface olduğunu belirtmek için isminin önüne I harfini getirmek bir best-practice olacaktır. Böylece kodlama yaparken inherit aldığımız yapının bir class mı yoksa interface mi olduğunu kolaylıkla ayırt edebiliriz. Bu kadar teorik bilgiden sonra basitçe bir interface tanımlayalım.

interface ILog{    void LogEkle(string kayit);}
Bu interface’ten türeyen tüm sınıflar LogEkle(string kayit) metodunu implement etmek zorundadır. Interface hakkında internette bir arama yaptığınızda genellikle kendisini inherit alan sınıflar için bir kontrat olduğundan bahsedilir. Kontrat kelimesiyle anlatılmak istenen tam olarak budur. Türeyen sınıflar, interface’in içerisinde yer alan tüm metodları implement edeceğine dair bir söz vermekte, sözleşme yapmaktadır. Aksi halde derleyici hata verecek, kodunuz çalışmayacaktır.
Genel olarak Interface’lerin özelliklerinden bahsetmemiz gerekirse;
•	new keywordü ile nesneleri oluşturulamaz.
•	Bir sınıfın ne yapması gerektiğini belirtir, nasıl yapması gerektiğini değil.
•	Default olarak tüm Interface üyeleri abstract ve public olarak tanımlanır. Sizin özellikle belirtmeniz gerekmez.
•	Bir sınıf birden fazla interface’i inherit edebilir, çoklu kalıtım (multiple-inheritance) desteklenir.
•	İçerisinde yalnızca metodların imzaları yer alır, içi dolu metod bulunduramazlar.
•	Kendisinden inherit alacak sınıflar ile arasında “can-do” ilişkisi vardır.
Can-do İlişkisi Nedir?
Çarpışan araba senaryosundan bir örnekle açıklamak gerekirse,
Çarpışan araba can-do hızlanmak. 
Açıklamaya gerek var mı bilemedim açıkçası ama abstract sınıflarda açıklamışken burada boş bırakmak içime sinmezdi. Çarpışan araba hızlanabilir diyoruz. Çarpışan arabanın bir davranışından bahsediyoruz.
Interfaceleri tam olarak can-do ilişkileri içeren yapılarda kullanmamız isabetli olacaktır. Senaryomuzdaki çarpışan araba hızlanabilir. Bu çarpışan arabanın yapabileceği bir kabiliyetigöstermektedir. Can-do ilişkisi davranışları, kabiliyetleri belirtir. Bu kabiliyetin interface içerisinde tanımlanması çok daha doğru olacaktır.

BU da iyi açıklama:
An abstract class is a way to achieve the abstraction in C#. An Abstract class is never intended to be instantiated directly. This class must contain at least one abstract method, which is marked by the keyword or modifier abstract in the class definition. The Abstract classes are typically used to define a base class in the class hierarchy.


Example:

// C# program to illustrate the 
// concept of abstract class 
using System; 
   
public abstract class G { 
    public abstract void gfg1(); 
} 

public class G1 : G { 
  
    // abstract method 'gfg1()' 
    // declare here with 
    // 'override' keyword 
    public override void gfg1() 
    { 
        Console.WriteLine("Class name is G1"); 
    } 
} 
  
// class 'G' inherit in 
// another child class 'G2' 
public class G2 : G { 
  
    // same as the previous class 
    public override void gfg1() 
    { 
        Console.WriteLine("Class name is  G2"); 
    } 
} 
  
// Driver Class 
public class main_method { 
  
    // Main Method 
    public static void Main() 
    { 
  
        // 'obj' is object of class 
        // 'G' class ' 
        // G' cannot 
        // be instantiate 
        G obj; 
  
        // instantiate class 'G1' 
        obj = new G1(); 
  
        // call 'gfg1()' of class 'G1' 
        obj.gfg1(); 
  
        // instantiate class 'G2' 
        obj = new G2(); 
  
        // call 'gfg1()' of class 'G2' 
        obj.gfg1(); 
    } 
} 
Output :



Class name is G1
Class name is  G2

Like a class, Interface can have methods, properties, events, and indexers as its members. But interfaces will contain only the declaration of the members. The implementation of interface’s members will be given by the class who implements the interface implicitly or explicitly.

Example:

// C# program to illustrate the 
// concept of interface 
using System; 
  
// A simple interface 
interface interface1 { 
  
    // method having only declaration 
    // not definition 
    void show(); 
} 
  
// A class that implements the interface. 
class MyClass : interface1 { 
  
    // providing the body part of function 
    public void show() 
    { 
        Console.WriteLine("Welcome to GeeksforGeeks!!!"); 
    } 
  
    // Main Method 
    public static void Main(String[] args) 
    { 
  
        // Creating object 
        MyClass obj1 = new MyClass(); 
  
        // calling method 
        obj1.show(); 
    } 
} 
Output:
Welcome to GeeksforGeeks!!!
Difference between Abstract Class and Interface
ABSTRACT CLASS	INTERFACE
It contains both declaration and definition part.	It contains only a declaration part.
Multiple inheritance is not achieved by abstract class.	Multiple inheritance is achieved by interface.
It contain constructor.
It does not contain constructor.

It can contain static members.	It does not contain static members.
It can contain different types of access modifiers like public, private, protected etc.	It only contains public access modifier because everything in the interface is public.
The performance of an abstract class is fast.	The performance of interface is slow because it requires time to search actual method in the corresponding class.
It is used to implement the core identity of class.	It is used to implement peripheral abilities of class.
A class can only use one abstract class.	A class can use multiple interface.
If many implementations are of the same kind and use common behavior, then it is superior to use abstract class.	If many implementations only share methods, then it is superior to use Interface.
Abstract class can contain methods, fields, constants, etc.	Interface can only contain methods .
It can be fully, partially or not implemented.	It should be fully implemented.

RESTful API  
(representational state transfer)    (GITHUB)
Restful api nedir?
A RESTful API is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data.

A RESTful API -- also referred to as a RESTful web service -- is based on representational state transfer (REST) technology, an architectural style and approach to communications often used in web services development.

REST technology is generally preferred to the more robust Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) technology because REST leverages less bandwidth, making it more suitable for internet usage. An API for a website is code that allows two software programs to communicate with each another . The API spells out the proper way for a developer to write a program requesting services from an operating system or other application.

Method Signature 	(GITHUB)
Method Signature nedir

the method signature for your method is:

DoSomething(int, int)

(Yani bir method signature şunlardan oluşur: metod adı, parametrelerin tipi)

Return type is not part of the method signature in C#. Only the method name and its parameters types (but not the parameter names) are part of the signature. You cannot, for example, have these two methods:

int DoSomething(int a, int b);
string DoSomething(int a, int b);

To be clear: Methods cannot be overloaded based on their return type. They must have a unique name, unique parameter types, or pass their arguments differently (e.g. using out or ref).

Edit: To answer your original question, the method signature for your method is:
DoSomething(int, int)
Note that this all applies to normal methods. If you're talking about delegates, then you should see keyboardP's answer. (Short version: return type IS part of the signature for a delegate).

Detay:
Is the return type is a part of signature or not?
It depends on why you are asking the question. Why do you care?
There are two definitions of method signature. The C# language definition does not include the return type, and uses the signature of the method to determine whether two overloads are allowed. Two methods with the same signature are not allowed in a type. Since C# does not consider the return type to be a part of the signature, C# does not allow two methods that differ only in return type to be declared in the same type.
The CLR, however, does include the return type in the signature. The CLR allows for two methods to be in the same type that differ only in return type.
To be more specific: in C# the signature consists of the methods:
•	name
•	number of type parameters
•	number of formal parameters
•	type of each formal parameter
•	out/ref/value-ness of each formal parameter
with the following additional notes:
•	generic type parameter constraints are not part of the signature
•	return type is not part of the signature
•	type parameter and formal parameter names are not part of the signature
•	two methods may not differ only in out/ref
In the CLR the signature consists of:
•	name
•	number of type parameters
•	number of formal parameters
•	type of each formal parameter including modopts and modreqs
•	return type including modopts and modreqs
•	ref/value-ness of each formal parameter
Note that the CLR does not distinguish between "ref int" and "out int" at all when considering signatures. Note that the CLR does distinguish between modopt/modreq types. (The way that the C# compiler deals with modopt/modreq types is too complex to summarize here.)

Method Overriding (Override) (GITHUB)
method overriding nedir, override nedir

Method Overriding
 
Overriding can be defined as: being able to change or augment the behavior of methods in classes, known as overriding their logic; it is one of the most powerful aspects of Object Oriented Programming.
Explanation
Suppose you have a Phone, no please don’t suppose everyone has a phone today, although some people even have more than one. Okay leave it, so if you have phone:

Then there must be ring facility in it:
 
Now your phone can be of any type, like it can be cellular, satellite or landline, these all types of phones will also have the same or a different functionality (based on their attribute).
 
Now whenever you receive a call, the caller doesn’t know whether you have a cellular phone, landline phone or anything else, he/she just calls you and according to that call operation your phone rings. In the case of method overriding, your phone works as a class and the ring is the functionality.

Keywords in Method Overriding
 
There are the following 3 types of keywords used in C# for method overriding.
 
Override Keyword
In the subclass, it tells the compiler that this method is overriding the same named method in the base class.
1.	public override int myValue()  
2.	{  
3.	     -  
4.	     -  
5.	     -  
6.	}  
Base Keyword
 
In the subclass, it calls the base class method for overriding functionality.
1.	base.myValue();  
Method Overriding Example
1.	using System;  
2.	using System.Collections.Generic;  
3.	using System.Linq;  
4.	using System.Text;  
5.	namespace Hello_Word  
6.	{  
7.	    class baseClass  
8.	    {  
9.	        public virtual void Greetings()  
10.	        {  
11.	            Console.WriteLine("baseClass Saying Hello!");  
12.	        }  
13.	    }  
14.	    class subClass : baseClass  
15.	    {  
16.	        public override void Greetings()  
17.	        {  
18.	            base.Greetings();  
19.	            Console.WriteLine("subClass Saying Hello!");  
20.	        }  
21.	    }  
22.	    class Program  
23.	    {  
24.	        static void Main(string[] args)  
25.	        {  
26.	            baseClass obj1 = new subClass();  
27.	            obj1.Greetings();  
28.	            Console.ReadLine();  
29.	        }  
30.	    }  
31.	}  
  
 
An output window is showing that baseClass will get called first and then subclass. If we make certain changes in this code like:
1.	base.Greetings();  
2.	Console.WriteLine("subClass Saying Hello!"); // current scenario  
After making a few modifications as in the following:
1.	Console.WriteLine("subClass Saying Hello!");  
2.	base.Greetings(); // after modifications  
Now our output will be like this:
 

 

If we remove "base.Greetings();" then the compiler will not call the baseclass as in the following:
1.	using System;  
2.	using System.Collections.Generic;  
3.	using System.Linq;  
4.	using System.Text;  
5.	namespace Hello_Word  
6.	{  
7.	    class baseClass  
8.	    {  
9.	        public virtual void Greetings()  
10.	        {  
11.	            Console.WriteLine("baseClass Saying Hello!");  
12.	        }  
13.	    }  
14.	    class subClass : baseClass  
15.	    {  
16.	        public override void Greetings()  
17.	        {  
18.	            Console.WriteLine("subClass Saying Hello!");  
19.	            // base.Greetings();  
20.	        }  
21.	    }  
22.	    class Program  
23.	    {  
24.	        static void Main(string[] args)  
25.	        {  
26.	            baseClass obj1 = new subClass();  
27.	            obj1.Greetings();  
28.	            Console.ReadLine();  
29.	        }  
30.	    }  
31.	}  
  
 
Now making some other changes, like placing:
1.	baseClass obj1 = new baseClass();  
2.	obj1.Greetings();  
Instead of:
1.	baseClass obj1 = new subClass();  
2.	obj1.Greetings();  

Now let’s check the output window, what’s its showing now:
 
  
 
So as you are seeing that now its calling only the baseClass. So now I guess you will be a little closer to the method overriding functionality.

Method Overriding is a technique that allows the invoking of functions from another class (base class) in the derived class. Creating a method in the derived class with the same signature as a method in the base class is called as method overriding.

Bi örnek yaptım. Override'siz metot da çalışıyor hata vermiyor. Benim aşağıdaki kodda incelediğim durum şu linkte de inceleniyor: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-sharp-method-overriding/
    class Program
    {
        class BaseClass
        {
            public virtual void SampleMethod()
            {
                Console.WriteLine("base");
            }

            public void SecondMethod()
            {
                Console.WriteLine("SecondMethod-Base");
            }
        }

        class DerivedClass : BaseClass
        {
            public override void SampleMethod()
            {
                Console.WriteLine("derived");
            }

            public void SecondMethod()
            {
                Console.WriteLine("SecondMethod-DerivedClass");
            }
        }
        class Main_Method
        {
            static void Main()
            {
                DerivedClass d = new DerivedClass();
                d.SampleMethod();

                BaseClass b = new DerivedClass();
                b.SampleMethod();

                BaseClass bc = new BaseClass();
                bc.SampleMethod();

                Console.WriteLine("-");
                d.SecondMethod();
                b.SecondMethod();
                bc.SecondMethod();
            }
        }
    }

Method Overriding in C# is similar to the virtual function in C++. Method Overriding is a technique that allows the invoking of functions from another class (base class) in the derived class. Creating a method in the derived class with the same signature as a method in the base class is called as method overriding.
In simple words, Overriding is a feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes. When a method in a subclass has the same name, same parameters or signature and same return type(or sub-type) as a method in its super-class, then the method in the subclass is said to override the method in the super-class. Method overriding is one of the ways by which C# achieve Run Time Polymorphism(Dynamic Polymorphism).
The method that is overridden by an override declaration is called the overridden base method. An override metho d is a new implementation of a member that is inherited from a base class. The overridden base method must be virtual, abstract, or override.
 
Example:
class base_class
{
    public void gfg();
}

class derived_class : base_class
{
    public void gfg();
}

class Main_Method
{
 static void Main()
 {
    derived_class d = new derived_class();
    d.gfg();
 }
}
Here the base class is inherited in the derived class and the method gfg() which has the same signature in both the classes, is overridden.

Interface 	(GITHUB)
Interface nedir, interface nedir
An interface defines a contract. Any class or struct that implements that contract must provide an implementation of the members defined in the interface. Beginning with C# 8.0, an interface may define a default implementation for members. It may also define static members in order to provide a single implementation for common functionality.
In the following example, class ImplementationClass must implement a method named SampleMethod that has no parameters and returns void.
For more information and examples, see Interfaces.
Example
interface ISampleInterface
{
    void SampleMethod();
}

class ImplementationClass : ISampleInterface
{
    // Explicit interface member implementation:
    void ISampleInterface.SampleMethod()
    {
        // Method implementation.
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        // Declare an interface instance.
        ISampleInterface obj = new ImplementationClass();

        // Call the member.
        obj.SampleMethod();
    }
}
An interface can be a member of a namespace or a class. An interface declaration can contain declarations (signatures without any implementation) of the following members:
•	Methods
•	Properties
•	Indexers
•	Events
These preceding member declarations typically do not contain a body. Beginning with C# 8.0, an interface member may declare a body. This is called a default implementation. Members with bodies permit the interface to provide a "default" implementation for classes and structs that don't provide an overriding implementation. In addition, beginning with C# 8.0, an interface may include:
•	Constants
•	Operators
•	Static constructor.
•	Nested types
•	Static fields, methods, properties, indexers, and events
•	Member declarations using the explicit interface implementation syntax.
•	Explicit access modifiers (the default access is public).
Interfaces may not contain instance state. While static fields are now permitted, instance fields are not permitted in interfaces. Instance auto-properties are not supported in interfaces, as they would implicitly declare a hidden field. This rule has a subtle effect on property declarations. In an interface declaration, the following code does not declare an auto-implemented property as it does in a class or struct. Instead, it declares a property that doesn't have a default implementation but must be implemented in any type that implements the interface:

public interface INamed
{
  public string Name {get; set;}
}
An interface can inherit from one or more base interfaces. When an interface overrides a method implemented in a base interface, it must use the explicit interface implementation syntax.
When a base type list contains a base class and interfaces, the base class must come first in the list.
A class that implements an interface can explicitly implement members of that interface. An explicitly implemented member cannot be accessed through a class instance, but only through an instance of the interface. In addition, default interface members can only be accessed through an instance of the interface.
For more information about explicit interface implementation, see Explicit Interface Implementation.
Example
The following example demonstrates interface implementation. In this example, the interface contains the property declaration and the class contains the implementation. Any instance of a class that implements IPoint has integer properties x and y.
interface IPoint
{
   // Property signatures:
   int X
   {
      get;
      set;
   }

   int Y
   {
      get;
      set;
   }

   double Distance
   {
       get;
   }
}

class Point : IPoint
{
   // Constructor:
   public Point(int x, int y)
   {
      X = x;
      Y = y;
   }

   // Property implementation:
   public int X { get; set; }

   public int Y { get; set; }

   // Property implementation
   public double Distance =>
      Math.Sqrt(X * X + Y * Y);

}

class MainClass
{
   static void PrintPoint(IPoint p)
   {
      Console.WriteLine("x={0}, y={1}", p.X, p.Y);
   }

   static void Main()
   {
      IPoint p = new Point(2, 3);
      Console.Write("My Point: ");
      PrintPoint(p);
   }
}
// Output: My Point: x=2, y=3

An interface is a completely abstract class, which contains only abstract members.
It is declared using the interface keyword:

        public interface IShape
        {
            void Draw();
        }

All members of the interface are by default abstract, so no need to use the abstract keyword. 
Also, all members of an interface are always public, and no access modifiers can be applied to them.
It is common to use the capital letter I as the starting letter for an interface name.
Interfaces can contain properties, methods, etc. but cannot contain fields (variables).
When a class implements an interface, it must also implement, or define, all of its methods.
The term implementing an interface is used (opposed to the term "inheriting from") to describe the process of creating a class based on an interface. The interface simply describes what a class should do. The class implementing the interface must define how to accomplish the behaviors.
The syntax to implement an interface is the same as that to derive a class: 

        public interface IShape
        {
            void Draw();
        }
        class Circle : IShape
        {
            public void Draw()
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Circle Draw");
            }
        }
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            IShape c = new Circle();
            c.Draw();
            //Outputs "Circle Draw"
        }

Note, that the override keyword is not needed when you implement an interface.

But why use interfaces rather than abstract classes? 
A class can inherit from just one base class, but it can implement multiple interfaces!
Therefore, by using interfaces you can include behavior from multiple sources in a class.
To implement multiple interfaces, use a comma separated list of interfaces when creating the class: class A: IShape, IAnimal, etc.

Merhaba,
Önceki yazılarımda SOLID prensiplerinden S–Tek Sorumluluk Prensibi(Single Responsibility Principle – SRP)‘ni ve O–Açık Kapalı Prensibi(Open Closed Principle – OCP) incelemiştik. Bu yazımızda ise sıradaki L timsaline denk gelen Liskov’un Yerine Geçme Prensibi(Liskov Substitution Principle – LSP) izah edeceğim.
Liskov’un Yerine Geçme Prensibi, diğerlerine göre anlaşılması en zor prensiptir diyebilirim. Barbara Liskov adlı hanımefendi tarafından 1988 yılında ‘Data Abstraction and Hierarchy’ isimli kitabında bu prensip gündeme getirilmiştir.
Her zor konuda olduğu gibi haliyle bu konuda “aslınnda anlaşıldığında çook basitt” diyeceğimiz bir konudur. Lakin bu konuyu zorlaştıran Barbara Liskov’un konuyla alakalı yaptığı açıklamadır. Bunun yanında 2. ve 3. kaynakların konuyu daha basit seviyede anlaşılır bir üslupla ele almalarıdır. Ee son olarakda bizim nam-ı diğer Türkler’in üzerine cila çekmesidir.
Tabi yukarıdaki paragrafta anlattığım durum, kitaplardan ya da makalelerden konuyu okuyarak tek başına öğrenme gayretinde bulunanlar içindir. Eğer alanında uzman bir eğiticiden 1. dereceden eğitim alarak ilgili konuya fakıf olmuşsanız burada yazdıklarıma hak vermemeniz gayet doğal olacaktır.
Velhasıl, bu zorlu ama anlaşılmayı bekleyen konuyu bu makale sonunda net bir şekilde idrak edeceğinizi umuyorum. Tabi öncelikle kitaplarda ve konuyla ilgili makalelerde kafamızı karıştıran tanımlamalara ve yorumlara yer vererek konuya giriş yapıyorum.
Nedir Bu Liskov’un Yerine Geçme Prensibi
LSP’yi orataya atan Barbara Liskov öncülüğünde bir çok kişi ilgili konuyu açıklamaya çalışmış, doğal olarak farklı yaklaşımlardan dolayı farklı izahlar ortaya çıkmıştır. Şimdi bunların bir kısmına göz atalım.
Barbara Liskov’a göre;
Aranan yer değiştirme özelliği şöyle tanımlanabilir: T cinsinden parametre alan tüm programlar (fonksiyonlar) P olacak şekilde, S tipinde o1 nesnesi ve T tipinde o2 nesnesi olsun. Eğer o1 ile o2 nesneleri yer değiştirdiğinde P’nin davranışı değişmiyorsa S tipi T tipinin alt tipidir!
Evet, bende bişey anlamadım.
Bilimsel olarak matematik ile formülüze bir şekilde LSP’ye açıklama getirmişler. O açıklamaya göreyse;
q(x) fonksiyonu T tipindeki x nesnesi için kanıtlanabilirdir. O halde T tipinin alt tipi olan S tipindeki y nesnesi için de q(y) fonksiyonu kanıtlanabilir olmalıdır.
Evet, bundanda bişey anlamadığımız aşikar.
‘Uncle Bob’ lakaplı Robert Cecil Martin ise LSP’yi daha anlaşılır bir vaziyette aşağıdaki gibi izah etmiştir;
Temel sınıfın(base class) işaretçisini(pointer) ya da referansını kullanan fonksiyonlar, bu sınıftan türemiş olan sınıfları(derived class) da ekstra bilgiye ihtiyaç duymaksızın kullanabilmelidir.
Ehhh… Biraz daha yazılımcıya uygun bir açıklama olmuş gibi. En azından base classlar derived classlar derken kafada bişeylerin hayalini kurabiliyoruz. O kadar literatür taradım, kaynak okudum ama şu yukarıdaki açıklamanın bana polimorfizmi anımsattığı kadar kimse gıram bahsetmemiş. Haliyle algıladığımdan şüphelenir oldum. Eğer kaçırdığım bir mana, bir kelime yahut edat bağlaç varsa haber verinde neden yanlış anlamışım farkına varmama yardımcı olun.
Siz bana Uncle Bob’un sözündeki algı hatamı izah edene kadar benim şu kanaatte olduğumu bilmenizi isterim ki, bu yukarıdaki açıklamaların hiçbirinden bir cacık olmaz! Anlamak için anlaşılır bir açıklama gerek. Koskoca prensibi batı algısıyla özetleyecez derken aman dikkat önemsizleştirmeyelim!
Şimdi konuya şahsen girmeden önce bizim Türkler’in konuya getirdikleri açıklamalara göz atalım. (Adreslerini verdiğim yerli yazılımcılar konuyla ilgili araştırma yaparken internette tesadüfen denk geldiklerimdir.)
Ömer İşıker;
Temel sınıfta aşağıdaki sınıflara ait özel fonksiyon vs bulunmamalıdır. Yani temel sınıfta türemiş sınıflardan hiç biri için özel bir şey yazılmış olmamalıdır.
Bu açıklama Ömer İşıker tarafından şu adresteki LSP ile ilgili makalede yer almaktadır. Kanaatimce LSP’ye izahatte bulunmamızı sağlayan yeterli bir açıklama değildir.
Türkay Ürkmez;
Aynı temel sınıftan türeyen tüm sınıflar, birbirlerinin yerine kullanılabilir olmalıdır. Bu yer değiştirme durumunda, sınıfa özel bir istisna kesinlikle oluşmamalıdır.
Şahsi kanaatim, konuya en iyi açıklama getiren Türk yazarımız Türkay Ürkmez’dir. Türkay Ürkmez’in konuyla ilgili makalesi için tıklayınız.
Bir adette ekşi sözlükte konuya izahatte bulunan arkadaşımızın düşüncesini görelim.
yeni bir istek geldi müşteriden, sen de bunu sağlamak için mevcut olan bir class’ten child class üretiyorsun, veyahut method’ları override ediyorsun. mevcut class yerine child class’i kullandığında bir hata oluşmamalı ya da worst case’de çıkan hata, bütün uygulamayı darmadağın etmemeli. türetilmiş sınıflar (ihtiyaç üzerine method’ları override edilmiş ya da extend edilmiş), türetilikleri class’ler ile değiştirilebilir olmalıdır kısaca.
Evet, bu arkadaşımız bayağı uçuk bir izahatte bulunmuşlar. Kanımca LSP’yi ya anlamamış ya da “sttir et LPS’yi… bakın ben terminoloji biliyorum” diye duyurma derdinde. Ha konuyla alakasını sorarsanız eksilerde tabi… Entrye buradan ulaşabilirsiniz.
Daha sürüsüne bereket Türk yazılım geliştirici tarafından ilgili konu ele alınmıştır. Fazla kafa karıştırmak istemediğim için alıntılarda bunlarla yetiniyorum  
Şimdi LSP’yi kendimiz ele alalım.
Barbara Liskov’un ortaya attığı bu prensibe göre üst sınıf ile alt sınıf arasında davranış olarak hiçbir fark olmamalıdır. Yani birbirlerinin yerine kullanılabilmelidirler.
Düşünün ki, arabanıza bir klima düğmesi koydunuz ve onu işlevsiz bıraktınız. Yani görüntüden ibaret ama iş yok. İşte bu durum LSP’ye aykırıdır. LSP, Dummy Code(Sahte kod) dediğimiz bu tarz duruma hayır demektedir. Yani bir düğme varsa işlevide olmalıdır. Buradan yola çıkarsak eğer base classların(kalıtım veren sınıfların), derived classlardaki(kalıtım alan sınıflardaki) işlevselliği tam olarak yerine getirdiğinden emin olmalıyız.
Eee peki ne anlatmaya çalışıyoruz. Bir sınıfta bulunan herhangi bir işlev, kendisinden kalıtım alan sınıflarda kullanılmayacaksa eğer işte bu durum LSP’ye aykırı bir durumdur.
Örnek olarak şöyle bir senaryo çizelim.
Bir ordumuz olsun. Ordumuzdaki uçaklar bir yandan keşife çıkabilsin bir yandan da hedefi vurabilsin.

Yeni uçağımızın hedefi vurma özelliği yoktur. Lakin IUcak arayüzümüz tüm elemanları zorla uygulatmaktadır. Eee haliyle base class var olan HedefiVur metodunu derived classta kullanmayacağız. İşte yeni uçağımız(UcakD) için burada HedefiVur metodu Dummy Code yapısındadır.
Peki “HedefiVur” metodunu UcakD’de kullanmayacaksak aşağıdaki gibi önlem almalıyız.

                u.HedefiVur();
            }
        });
    }
}
Yukarıdaki işlem dışında UcakD’de HedefiVur çağrıldığı zaman hata fırlatılıp “Savas” sınıfımızda try catch bloklarıyla kontrol sağlanabilir.
Tabi bunlar konumuzun dışında kalan konulardır. Asıl mevzu LSP’yi ilgilendiren base classtaki kullanılmayacak kodu derived class’a zorla implement etmektir. Haliyle LSP’ye aykırı olan bu durum OCP‘ye de aykırıdır. Çünkü her yeni gelen ve hedefi vuramayan uçakta “Savas” sınıfı içerisinde yeni if – else bloklarıyla kontrol sağlamız gerekecektir. Buda değişiklik demektir.
Gelin şimdi bu sorunu Liskov’un Yerine Geçme Prensibini uygulayarak çözelim.

Class Diyagramında görüldüğü gibi herşey açık ve net. Tasarımımızı LSP’ye uygun bir vaziyette şekillendirebilmek için gördüğünüz gibi base classtaki tüm işlevler farklı arayüzlere bölmüş bulunmaktayım. Bu yaptığımız işlem bir sonraki yazımda ele alacağım arayüz ayrım prensibinede uyarlı bir yaklaşımdır.
“UcakA”, “UcakB” ve “UcakC” hedefi vurma ve keşif yapma özelliklerine sahip oldukları için iki arayüzden de kalıtım almaktadırlar. “UcakD” ise sadece keşif yapabileceği için sadece “IUcakKesif” arayüzünden kalıtım almaktadır. Bu sayede kullanmayacağı bir işlev olan HedefiVur metodunu barındırmak zorunda kalmayacak ve Dummy Code durumunuda ortadan kaldırmış olacağız.

Struct 	(GITHUB) (örnek)
struct nedir

A struct type is a value type that is typically used to encapsulate small groups of related variables, such as the coordinates of a rectangle or the characteristics of an item in an inventory. The following example shows a simple struct declaration:
        struct Book
        {
            public string title;
            public double price;
            public string author;
        }
Structs share most of the same syntax as classes, but are more limited than classes.
Unlike classes, structs can be instantiated without using a new operator.
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Book b;
            b.title = "Test";
            b.price = 5.99;
            b.author = "David";

            Console.WriteLine(b.title);
            //Outputs "Test"
        }
Structs do not support inheritance and cannot contain virtual methods.

Structs can contain methods, properties, indexers, and so on. Structs cannot contain default constructors (a constructor without parameters), but they can have constructors that take parameters. In that case the new keyword is used to instantiate a struct object, similar to class objects.

        struct Point
        {
            public int x;
            public int y;

            public Point(int x, int y)  // Constructor
            {
                this.x = x;
                this.y = y;
            }
        }
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Point p = new Point(10, 15);
            Console.WriteLine(p.x);
            // Outputs 10
        }

Struct vs. Class 	(GITHUB) (örnek)
struct nedir, class nedir, struct vs class

In general, classes are used to model more complex behavior, or data, that is intended to be modified after a class object is created. Structs are best suited for small data structures that contain primarily data that is not intended to be modified after the struct is created. Consider defining a struct instead of a class if you are trying to represent a simple set of data. 

All standard C# types (int, double, bool, char, etc.) are actually structs.

Merhaba,
Programlama dillerinde en mühim OOP(Object Oriented Programing) yapılarından olan class yapısına göre daha basit düzeyde işlemler gerçekleştirmemizi sağlayan ve belirli bir takım kısıtlamaları yanında barındıran struct yapısını C# diline özel ele alacağız.
Şimdi düşünün ki, bir yapı oluşturacaksınız ve bu yapı birbirleriyle ilişkili verileri barındıracaktır. Haliyle bunu bir class olarak belirleyebilir ve o classtan üretilen nesne üzerinde işlemlerimizi icra edebiliriz. Amma velakin bu yapımız class kadar kompleks işlemler için tasarlanmış bir yapı gerektirmiyorsa ve tutulacak verileri enkapsüle etmek yetiyorsa işte bu tarz durumlarda struct yapısını tercih edebiliriz.
Unutmayınız ki, classlar bir Referans Tipli(Reference Types) özellik gösterirken struct yapıları bir Değer Tipli(Value Types) değişken özelliği göstermektedir.
Yani anlayacağınız “int” gibi, “bool” gibi değer tipli bir değişken oluşturmak istiyorsanız struct yapısını tercih edebilirsiniz.
Bu demek oluyor ki, gerçekleştireceğimiz işlevselliğin yapısal olarak bir nesne yahut değer tipli bir değişken yapısında gerçekleştirilmesini tercih edebilir ve birazdan bahsedeceğim olumlu olumsuz yanlarıda hesaba katarak projenizde performansı daha maliyetli bir hale getirebilirsiniz.
Şimdi struct yapısını C# perspektifinden adım adım değerlendirelim;
	Yazımızın yukarıdaki satırlarında da bahsettiğimiz gibi struct C#’ta value type yaratabileceğimiz yapıdır.
	struct yapıları, herhangi bir struct yahut class’tan kalıtım alamazlar.
 		 	
	Benzer şekilde bir class yapısıda struct yapısından miras alamamaktadır.
	struct yapıları, interface yapılarını uygulayabilmektedirler.

    }
}

    void A();
    void B(bool c);
}
	struct yapılar new keywordüyle örneklendirilebilmektedir. Burada iki durum söz konusudur.
1.	Eğer new operatörüyle örneklendirirsek ne olur?
Bildiğiniz gibi new operatörü classlarda kullanıldığı zaman ilgili classtan bir nesne talep edilmekte ve üretilen nesne belleğin Heap kısmında muhafaza edilmektedir. Ee söz gelimi struct yapısında da new operatörünü kullanırsak eğer evet ilgili yapıdan bir nesne üretilecektir ama struct bir değer tipli değişken yapısında olduğundan dolayı o nesne belleğin Stack kısmında muhafaza edilecektir.
Bu yapıya kadar oluşturduğumuz tüm nesnelerin Heap kısmında olduğunu söylemiştik. Halbuki Stack kısmında struct yapısında nesneleri tutabilmekteyiz.
Ayriyetten struct içerisindeki fieldlara default değerleri atanmış olacaktır.

2.	Eğer new operatörü kullanmazsak ne olur?

3.	Haliyle classlardaki gibi nesne mecburiyeti yoktur. Yani new operatörü ile struct yapıdan bir nesne üretmeden de o struct’ı kullanabilmekteyiz.
 
Yukarıda da gördüğünüz gibi nesnesiz structları kullanabilmekteyiz kullanmasına ama içerisindeki verilerin ilk değerleri atanmayacağından dolayı hata alınacaktır.
İşte böyle bir durumda ilk değerleri atayarak kullanmak gerekecektir.

Evet, gördüğünüz gibi struct dediğimiz aslen yapısal ve içerik(implicit) olarak bir sealed class‘tır diyebiliriz. Bunun yanında daha hafif(lightweight) bir class yapısı olduğu söylenebilir. İçeriğimizden de anlaşılacağına göre Tip Tanımlama(Type Definition) yaparken kullanabiliriz.
İçerikte bahsedildiği gibi referans değil, değer tipli bir yapı göstermesinin sebebini aşağıdaki örnekten de anlayabiliriz.

Burada dikkat ederseniz eğer ms.x ve ms.y değişmeyeceğinden dolayı bir Deep Copy söz konusudur. Eğer referans tipli yapılar olsalardı aşağıdaki gibi bir sonuç elde edilecekti ve Shallow Copy söz konusu olacaktı.
 
Gördüğünüz gibi iki referansta aynı nesneyi işaret ettiğinden dolayı referanslar üzerindeki field değerleri doğal olarak aynı sonucu vermekte yani mc.x ve mc.y değişkenlik göstermektedir.
Son olarak struct yapılarıyla ilgili uç bir noktaya daha değinip içeriğimizi sonlandıralım.
struct yapılar, kendilerini this keywordünü kullanarak değiştirebilen yapılardır.
Örneğin;
 
Aslında bu tarz bir işleme class yapısı izin vermediğinden dolayı ilginç bir özelliktir.

In C#, a structure is a value type data type. It helps you to make a single variable hold related data of various data types. The struct keyword is used for creating a structure.
Structures are used to represent a record. Suppose you want to keep track of your books in a library. You might want to track the following attributes about each book −
•	Title
•	Author
•	Subject
•	Book ID
Defining a Structure
To define a structure, you must use the struct statement. The struct statement defines a new data type, with more than one member for your program.
For example, here is the way you can declare the Book structure −
struct Books {
   public string title;
   public string author;
   public string subject;
   public int book_id;
};  
The following program shows the use of the structure −
Live Demo
using System;

struct Books {
   public string title;
   public string author;
   public string subject;
   public int book_id;
};  

public class testStructure {
   public static void Main(string[] args) {
      Books Book1;   /* Declare Book1 of type Book */
      Books Book2;   /* Declare Book2 of type Book */

      /* book 1 specification */
      Book1.title = "C Programming";
      Book1.author = "Nuha Ali"; 
      Book1.subject = "C Programming Tutorial";
      Book1.book_id = 6495407;

      /* book 2 specification */
      Book2.title = "Telecom Billing";
      Book2.author = "Zara Ali";
      Book2.subject =  "Telecom Billing Tutorial";
      Book2.book_id = 6495700;

      /* print Book1 info */
      Console.WriteLine( "Book 1 title : {0}", Book1.title);
      Console.WriteLine("Book 1 author : {0}", Book1.author);
      Console.WriteLine("Book 1 subject : {0}", Book1.subject);
      Console.WriteLine("Book 1 book_id :{0}", Book1.book_id);

      /* print Book2 info */
      Console.WriteLine("Book 2 title : {0}", Book2.title);
      Console.WriteLine("Book 2 author : {0}", Book2.author);
      Console.WriteLine("Book 2 subject : {0}", Book2.subject);
      Console.WriteLine("Book 2 book_id : {0}", Book2.book_id);       

      Console.ReadKey();
   }
}
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −
Book 1 title : C Programming
Book 1 author : Nuha Ali
Book 1 subject : C Programming Tutorial
Book 1 book_id : 6495407
Book 2 title : Telecom Billing
Book 2 author : Zara Ali
Book 2 subject : Telecom Billing Tutorial
Book 2 book_id : 6495700
Features of C# Structures
You have already used a simple structure named Books. Structures in C# are quite different from that in traditional C or C++. The C# structures have the following features −
•	Structures can have methods, fields, indexers, properties, operator methods, and events.
•	Structures can have defined constructors, but not destructors. However, you cannot define a default constructor for a structure. The default constructor is automatically defined and cannot be changed.
•	Unlike classes, structures cannot inherit other structures or classes.
•	Structures cannot be used as a base for other structures or classes.
•	A structure can implement one or more interfaces.
•	Structure members cannot be specified as abstract, virtual, or protected.
•	When you create a struct object using the New operator, it gets created and the appropriate constructor is called. Unlike classes, structs can be instantiated without using the New operator.
•	If the New operator is not used, the fields remain unassigned and the object cannot be used until all the fields are initialized.

Class versus Structure
Classes and Structures have the following basic differences −
•	classes are reference types and structs are value types
•	structures do not support inheritance
•	structures cannot have default constructor
In the light of the above discussions, let us rewrite the previous example −
Live Demo
using System;

struct Books {
   private string title;
   private string author;
   private string subject;
   private int book_id;
   
   public void getValues(string t, string a, string s, int id) {
      title = t;
      author = a;
      subject = s;
      book_id = id;
   }
   
   public void display() {
      Console.WriteLine("Title : {0}", title);
      Console.WriteLine("Author : {0}", author);
      Console.WriteLine("Subject : {0}", subject);
      Console.WriteLine("Book_id :{0}", book_id);
   }
};  

public class testStructure {

   public static void Main(string[] args) {
      Books Book1 = new Books();   /* Declare Book1 of type Book */
      Books Book2 = new Books();   /* Declare Book2 of type Book */

      /* book 1 specification */
      Book1.getValues("C Programming",
      "Nuha Ali", "C Programming Tutorial",6495407);

      /* book 2 specification */
      Book2.getValues("Telecom Billing",
      "Zara Ali", "Telecom Billing Tutorial", 6495700);

      /* print Book1 info */
      Book1.display();

      /* print Book2 info */
      Book2.display(); 

      Console.ReadKey();
   }
}
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −
Title : C Programming
Author : Nuha Ali
Subject : C Programming Tutorial
Book_id : 6495407
Title : Telecom Billing
Author : Zara Ali
Subject : Telecom Billing Tutorial

C# - Struct
________________________________________
Updated on: June 25, 2020
________________________________________
In C#, struct is the value type data type that represents data structures. It can contain a parameterized constructor, static constructor, constants, fields, methods, properties, indexers, operators, events, and nested types.
struct can be used to hold small data values that do not require inheritance, e.g. coordinate points, key-value pairs, and complex data structure.
Structure Declaration
A structure is declared using struct keyword. The default modifier is internal for the struct and its members.
The following example declares a structure Coordinate for the graph.
Example: Structure
struct Coordinate
{
    public int x;
    public int y;
}
A struct object can be created with or without the new operator, same as primitive type variables.
Example: Create Structure
struct Coordinate
{
    public int x;
    public int y;
}

Coordinate point = new Coordinate();
Console.WriteLine(point.x); //output: 0  
Console.WriteLine(point.y); //output: 0  
Try it
Above, an object of the Coordinate structure is created using the new keyword. It calls the default parameterless constructor of the struct, which initializes all the members to their default value of the specified data type.
If you declare a variable of struct type without using new keyword, it does not call any constructor, so all the members remain unassigned. Therefore, you must assign values to each member before accessing them, otherwise, it will give a compile-time error.
Example: Create Structure Without new Keyword
struct Coordinate
{
    public int x;
    public int y;
}

Coordinate point;
Console.Write(point.x); // Compile time error  

point.x = 10;
point.y = 20;
Console.Write(point.x); //output: 10  
Console.Write(point.y); //output: 20  

Constructors in Structure
A struct cannot contain a parameterless constructor. It can only contain parameterized constructors or a static constructor.
Example: Parameterized Constructor in Struct
struct Coordinate
{
    public int x;
    public int y;

    public Coordinate(int x, int y)
    {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
}

Coordinate point = new Coordinate(10, 20);

Console.WriteLine(point.x); //output: 10  
Console.WriteLine(point.y); //output: 20  
Try it
You must include all the members of the struct in the parameterized constructor and assign parameters to members; otherwise C# compiler will give a compile-time error if any member remains unassigned.
Methods and Properties in Structure
A struct can contain properties, auto-implemented properties, methods, etc., same as classes.
Example: Methods and Properties in Struct
struct Coordinate
{
    public int x { get; set; }
    public int y { get; set; }

    public void SetOrigin()
    {
        this.x = 0;
        this.y = 0;
    }
}

Coordinate point = Coordinate();
point.SetOrigin();

Console.WriteLine(point.x); //output: 0  
Console.WriteLine(point.y); //output: 0  
Try it
The following struct includes the static method.
Example: Static Constructor in Struct
struct Coordinate
{
    public int x;
    public int y;

    public Coordinate(int x, int y)
    {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    public static Coordinate GetOrigin()
    {
        return new Coordinate();
    }
}

Coordinate point = Coordinate.GetOrigin();

Console.WriteLine(point.x); //output: 0  
Console.WriteLine(point.y); //output: 0  
Try it
Events in Structure
A struct can contain events to notify subscribers about some action. The following struct contains an event.
Example: Event in Structure
struct Coordinate
{
    private int _x, _y;

    public int x 
    {
        get{
            return _x;
        }

        set{
            _x = value;
            CoordinatesChanged(_x);
        }
    }

    public int y
    {
        get{
            return _y;
        }

        set{
            _y = value;
            CoordinatesChanged(_y);
        }
    }

    public event Action<int> CoordinatesChanged;
}
The above structure contains CoordinatesChanged event, which will be raised when x or y coordinate changes. The following example demonstrates the handling of the CoordinatesChanged event.
Example: Handle Structure Events
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {

        Coordinate point = new Coordinate();
        
        point.CoordinatesChanged += StructEventHandler;
        point.x = 10;
        point.y = 20;
    }

    static void StructEventHandler(int point)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Coordinate changed to {0}", point);
    }
} 
struct is a value type, so it is faster than a class object. Use struct whenever you want to just store the data. Generally, structs are good for game programming. However, it is easier to transfer a class object than a struct. So do not use struct when you are passing data across the wire or to other classes.
Summary
•	struct can include constructors, constants, fields, methods, properties, indexers, operators, events & nested types.
•	struct cannot include a parameterless constructor or a destructor.
•	struct can implement interfaces, same as class.
•	struct cannot inherit another structure or class, and it cannot be the base of a class.
•	struct members cannot be specified as abstract, sealed, virtual, or protected

Enumeration	(GITHUB) (örnek)
enumeration nedir

An enumeration is a complete, ordered listing of all the items in a collection. The term is commonly used in mathematics and computer science to refer to a listing of all of the elements of a set. The precise requirements for an enumeration (for example, whether the set must be finite, or whether the list is allowed to contain repetitions) depend on the discipline of study and the context of a given problem.
Some sets can be enumerated by means of a natural ordering (such as 1, 2, 3, 4, ... for the set of positive integers), but in other cases it may be necessary to impose a (perhaps arbitrary) ordering. In some contexts, such as enumerative combinatorics, the term enumeration is used more in the sense of counting – with emphasis on determination of the number of elements that a set contains, rather than the production of an explicit listing of those elements.

Enum 	(GITHUB) (örnek)
enum nedir, enum keyword nedir
The enum keyword is used to declare an enumeration: a type that consists of a set of named constants called the enumerator list.
By default, the first enumerator has the value 0, and the value of each successive enumerator is increased by 1.
For example, in the following enumeration, Sun is 0, Mon is 1, Tue is 2, and so on:

        enum Days { Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat };

You can also assign your own enumerator values:

        enum Days { Sun, Mon, Tue = 4, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat };

In the example above, the enumeration will start from 0.
Sun is 0, then Mon is 1, Tue is 4, Wed is 5, and so on. The value of the next item in an Enum is one increment of the previous value.
Note that the values are comma separated.
You can refer to the values in the Enum with the dot syntax.
In order to assign Enum values to int variables, you have to specify the type in parentheses:

        enum Days { Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat };

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int x = (int)Days.Sat;
            Console.WriteLine(x);
            Console.ReadKey();
            //Outputs 6
        }
Basically, Enums define variables that represent members of a fixed set.
Some sample Enum uses include month names, days of the week, cards in a deck, etc.

Total encapsulation sunar, bunu sağlamak isteyen programmer'lar interface kullanmalıdır. Multiple inheritance kullanma amacındaysak bu işi interface ile yapabiliriz. Tüm metotların sadece ne yaptığı belli, nasıl yaptığı belirsizdir çünkü interface içindeki memberlar sadece signature'a sahip olan metotlara sahiplerdir. İçi dolu olan, yani işlemi "nasıl" yaptığı belli olan bir metot barındırmaz. Dolayısıyla tam bir encapsulation sağlar.
Interface'in avantajları: 

•  It is used to achieve loose coupling.
•  It is used to achieve total abstraction.
•  To achieve component-based programming
•  To achieve multiple inheritance and abstraction.
•  Interfaces add a plug and play like architecture into applications.

  Points to Remember :
1.	An interface only contains declarations of method, properties, indexers, and events.
2.	An interface can be implement implicitly or explicitly by a class or struct.
3.	A class or struct which implements an interface, must use 'public' access modifier.
4.	An interface cannot include private, protected, or internal members. All the members are public by default.
5.	Do not include 'public' in an interface as all the members are public by default. C# will give compile-time error if used 'public'.
6.	Implement interface explicitly using InterfaceName. with all the members.
7.	An interface can inherit one or more interfaces.

An interface is like a contract. In the human world, the contract between the two or more humans binds them to act as per the contract. In the same way, the interface includes the declaration of one or more functionalities. Entities that implement the interface must define functionalities declared in the interface. In C#, a class or a struct can implement one or more interfaces.
In C#, an interface can be defined using the interface keyword. Interfaces can contain methods, properties, indexers, and events as members.
Consider the following IPen interface that declares some basic functionality for a pen.
Example: An Interface
interface IPen
{
    string Color { get; set; }
    bool Open();
    bool Close();
    void Write(string text);
}
Example: Invalid Interface with Access Modifiers
interface IPen
{
    public string Color { get; set; }  //error
    protected bool Open(); //error
    private bool Close();  //error
    protected internal void Write(string text);//error
}
An interface can only contain declarations but not implementations. The following will give a compile-time error.
Example: Invalid Interface with Implementation
interface IPen
{
    string Color { get; set; }
    bool Open();
    bool Close();
    void Write(string text){
        Console.Write(text);  //error: cannot implement method
    }
}
Implementing an Interface
For example, the following class implements IPen interface implicitly.
Example: Interface Implementation
class Cello : IPen
{
    public string Color { get; set; }
        
    private bool isOpen = false;
        
    public bool Close()
    {
        isOpen = false;
        Console.WriteLine("Cello closed for writing!");

        return isOpen;
    }

    public bool Open()
    {
        isOpen = true;
        Console.WriteLine("Cello open for writing!");
            
        return isOpen;
    }

    public void Write(string text)
    {
        //write text if open
        if(isOpen)
            Console.WriteLine("Cello: " + text);
    }
}
In the above example, the Cello class implements the IPen interface. It defines all the members of the IPen interface with public access modifier. However, other non-interface members of the class can have any access modifiers e.g. isOpen field is a private member of the Cello class.
 Note:
All the members of the interface must be implemented with the public modifier in a class or struct. C# will give a compile-time error if any one of the members declared other than public access modifier.
Explicit Interface Implementation
Explicit implementation is useful when class is implementing multiple interface thereby it is more readable and eliminates the confusion. It is also useful if interfaces have same method name coincidently.
 Note:
Do not use public modifier with an explicit implementation. It will give compile time error.
You can implement interface explicitly by prefixing interface name with all the members of an interface, as shown below:
Example: Explicit Implementation
class Cello : IPen
{
    string IPen.Color { get; set; }
        
    private bool isOpen = false;
        
    bool IPen.Close()
    {
        isOpen = false;
        Console.WriteLine("Cello closed for writing!");

        return isOpen;
    }

    bool IPen.Open()
    {
        isOpen = true;
        Console.WriteLine("Cello open for writing!");
            
        return isOpen;
    }

    void IPen.Write(string text)
    {
        //write text if open
        if(isOpen)
            Console.WriteLine("Cello: " + text);
    }
} 
In the above example of explicit implementation, notice that it cannot use access modifier 'public' explicitly. C# will give an error if you use 'public' modifier when implementing interface explicitly.

There can be multiple classes or structs that implements the same interface. Consider the following example.
class Parker : IPen
{
    public string Color { get; set; }
        
    private bool canWrite = false;
        
    public bool Close()
    {
        canWrite = false;
        Console.WriteLine("Parker is closed now!");

        return canWrite;
    }

    public bool Open()
    {
        canWrite = true;
        Console.WriteLine("Parker is open now!");
            
        return canWrite;
    }

    public void Write(string text)
    {
        //write text if open
        if(canWrite)
            Console.WriteLine("Parker: " + text);
    }
}
As you can see, the Parker class implements the IPen class. It implements the same functionalities declared in IPen class but in a different way than Cello class. (prints different messages in Open(), Close() and Write() methods.) Thus, multiple classes or Structs can implement the same interface which performs the same action but differently.
You can now create objects of the class and assigned to a variable of interface type.
Example: Interface Type Variable
IPen pen1 = new Cello();

IPen pen2 = new Parker();
Try it
The same variable can be used to instantiate all the classes which implemented IPen interface.
IPen mypen = new Cello();
mypen = new Parker(); // assign Parker object to same variable
Implement Multiple Interfaces
A class or struct can implement multiple interfaces and must define all the members of all interfaces.
Example: Implement Multiple Interface
interface IBrandedPen
{
    string GetBrandName();
}

class Parker : IPen, IBrandedPen
{
    //Implement all members of IPen and IBrandedPen
}
Now, the Parker class can be instantiated and assigned to either IPen or IBrandedPen interface, as shown below.
Example: Interface Type Variables
IPen pen1 = new Parker();
pen1.Open();// valid 
pen1.GetBrandName(); //Compile-time error. Cannot call IBrandedPen method on the object of type IPen

IBrandedPen pen2 = new Parker();
pen2.GetBrandName();// valid 
pen2.Open();//Compile-time error. Cannot call IPen method on the object of type IBrandedPen
Try it
As you can see, an object only supports methods of an interface to which it assigned to, e.g. pen1 assigned to IPen so only supports methods of IPen and not of IBrandedPen.
An interface can also inherit one or more interface.
Example: Interface Inheritance
interface IPen
{
    string Color { get; set; }
    bool Open();
    bool Close();
    void Write(string text);
}

interface IBrandedPen : IPen 
{
    string GetBrandName();
}

class Parker : IBrandedPen
{
    //Implement all members of IPen and IBrandedPen
}

Kendi yaptığım örnek, hata olabilir belki:
using System;
 
class Program
{
    public abstract class AbstractClass
    {
        //public abstract int AbstractInt; //hata verir: field can not be abstract.
 
        public int Number; //örnek field'ımızı oluşturmuş olduk.
        public string Text; //örnek field.
 
        //Aşağıdaki WriteSomething metodu AbstractClass'ı implement eden class'larda kullanılmak zorunda değil. Çünkü abstract değil bu metot. Interface - Abstract class arası farklardan birisi bu.
        public void WriteSomething()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("FullMethod içindeyiz.");
            //görüldüğü gibi, AbstractMethod'da sadece bir signature metot oluşturabilirken burada içi dolu, yani normal metotlar oluş
            //turabiliriz. Abstract class'larda bu yapılabilirken interface'lerde yapılamamaktadır.
        }
 
        //public abstract AbstractMethod(); //hata verir. Bir şey geriye dönmüyorsan void keyword eklemelisin. Aşağıdaki SampleMethod'a bak örneğin.
 
        public abstract NormalClass SampleMethod(); //abstact metot olduğu için override edilmelidir.
 
        public abstract void AbstractMethod(); //abstact metot olduğu için override edilmelidir.
    }
 
    public class NormalClass : AbstractClass

Html Helper 	(GITHUB - yetersiz) (örnek)
html helper nedir

HtmlHelper class generates html elements. For example, 
@Html.ActionLink("Create New", "Create") 
would generate anchor tag:
 <a href="/Student/Create">Create New</a>.
Visual Studio also provides minimum IntelliSense support when writing HTML Helpers, as the parameters for the HTML Helper methods are all strings. For example, in the following code, the LabelFor and TextBoxFor HTML Helper methods are used to create a label and textbox for a model property:
Copy
<div class="form-group"> 
    @Html.LabelFor(m => m.Email, new { @class = "col-md-2 control-label" }) 
    <div class="col-md-10"> 
        @Html.TextBoxFor(m => m.Email, new { @class = "form-control" }) 
    </div> 
</div> 
Because the class is a reserved word in C#, you will notice in the preceding code how you have to append the @ sign in order to...
The difference between HTML Helpers and Tag Helpers
Tag Helpers are attached to HTML elements inside your Razor views and can help you write markup that is both cleaner and easier to read than the traditional HTML Helpers. HTML Helpers, on the other hand, are invoked as methods that are mixed with HTML inside your Razor views.

Razor 	(GITHUB) (örnek)
razor nedir, razor view nedir
Razor bir markup syntax'ıdır. MVC'nin view tarafında kullanılır.
Razor is a markup syntax that lets you embed server-based code into web pages using C# and cshtml is the extension of razor file Cshtml = cs (C#) + HTML. Components are typically implemented in Razor Component files (.razor) using a combination of C# and HTML markup (.cshtml files are used in Blazor apps).

Reference Type, Value Type  	(GITHUB) (örnek)
Reference type nedir, Value type nedir,

Reference Data Types : The Reference Data Types will contain a memory address of variable value because the reference types won’t store the variable value directly in memory. The built-in reference types are string, object.

Value Data Types : In C#, the Value Data Types will directly store the variable value in memory and it will also accept both signed and unsigned literals. The derived class for these data types are System.ValueType. Following are different Value Data Types in C# programming language:…
Value Type VALUE TUTAR. Adı üstünde… Başka da bişey tutmaz. Yani sadece Value alacak… 0,1,2,3 gibi…
Reference Type da reference tutar. Adı üstünde. Yani referansını tutar…
Initialize etmediğimiz bir int değeri olsun;
Int newInt;
Bu obje'nin bu haldeki değeri 0 olur.Null olmaz. Çünkü int'ler value type'dır ve value'den başka bir şey tutamaz. (Int, yukarıdaki haliyle null olamaz, bir int değeri null olabilmesi için int? şeklinde declare edilmelidir)
String asdf;
Bu ise Reference Type olduğu için null değere işaret eder. Yani değeri NULL olur. Çünkü String'ler Reference Type'dır. Bir değeri yoktur. Değeri olmayan bir verinin ADRESİNİ TUTAR. Adresini tuttuğu şeyin değeri yoktur şu anda (String asdf;). Bu yüzden bu string'in şu anki değeri NULL olur.

Hypertext is text which contains links to other texts. The term was coined by Ted Nelson around 1965.
HyperMedia is a term used for hypertext which is not constrained to be text: it can include graphics, video and sound , for example. Apparently Ted Nelson was the first to use this term too.
Hypertext and HyperMedia are concepts, not products.

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers. 
HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server. 
A web browser may be the client, and an application on a computer that hosts a web site may be the server. 
Example: A client (browser) submits an HTTP request to the server; then the server returns a response to the client. The response contains status information about the request and may also contain the requested content.

Tag Helper	(GITHUB) (örnek)
Tag Helper nedir, taghelper nedir
Detay: https://docs.microsoft.com/tr-tr/aspnet/core/mvc/views/tag-helpers/intro?view=aspnetcore-3.0
Tag Helpers enable server-side code to participate in creating and rendering HTML elements in Razor files. Tag helpers are a new feature and similar to HTML helpers, which help us render HTML.

örnek:
Rendering Links
The easiest way to render an HTML link in a view is to use the HTML.ActionLink() helper. The Html.ActionLink() does not link to a view. Instead, you use the Html.ActionLink() helper to create a link to a controller action.
For example, the view in Listing 1 includes a link to an action named About (see Figure 1).
Figure 1 – Link rendered by Html.ActionLink() helper
 

Tag Helpers enable server-side code to participate in creating and rendering HTML elements in Razor files. For example, the built-in ImageTagHelper can append a version number to the image name. Whenever the image changes, the server generates a new unique version for the image, so clients are guaranteed to get the current image (instead of a stale cached image). There are many built-in Tag Helpers for common tasks - such as creating forms, links, loading assets and more - and even more available in public GitHub repositories and as NuGet packages. Tag Helpers are authored in C#, and they target HTML elements based on element name, attribute name, or parent tag. For example, the built-in LabelTagHelper can target the HTML <label> element when the LabelTagHelper attributes are applied. If you're familiar with HTML Helpers, Tag Helpers reduce the explicit transitions between HTML and C# in Razor views. In many cases, HTML Helpers provide an alternative approach to a specific Tag Helper, but it's important to recognize that Tag Helpers don't replace HTML Helpers and there's not a Tag Helper for each HTML Helper. Tag Helpers compared to HTML Helpers explains the differences in more detail.
public class Movie
{
    public int ID { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public DateTime ReleaseDate { get; set; }
    public string Genre { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}
The following Razor markup:
<label asp-for="Movie.Title"></label>
Generates the following HTML:
<label for="Movie_Title">Title</label>

Tag Helper nedir ve yararları nelerdir?
Tag helper server-side kodlarımızı html tagleri gibi oluşturup kullanmamızı sağlar. Tag Helper HTML ve C# arasındaki geçişleri azaltır.(Yani Razor görünümü azalır-@ kullanımı azalmış olur.) Bu da bizlere Viewmizin daha okunabilir, anlaşılabilir ve kolay geliştirilebilir hale getirmesini sağlamaktadır.

Örneğin;

  @Html.ActionLink("Go to index","Index","Home")
  <a asp-action="index" asp-controller="home" >Go to index</a>

HTML taglerimide asp- dediğimizde o tagin Tag Helperları kullanabiliriz. VS bizlere IntelliSense desteğini de sağlamaktadır.
Tag Helperları kullanmak istiyorsak 
View/_ViewImports.cshtml üzerinden yapıyoruz.

StringBuilder	(GITHUB) (örnek)
StringBuilder nedir
Detay:
The String object is immutable. Every time you use one of the methods in the System.String class, you create a new string object in memory, which requires a new allocation of space for that new object. In situations where you need to perform repeated modifications to a string, the overhead associated with creating a new String object can be costly. The System.Text.StringBuilder class can be used when you want to modify a string without creating a new object. For example, using the StringBuilder class can boost performance when concatenating many strings together in a loop.

Mutable and Immutable (GITHUB)  (örnek)
mutable nedir, immutable nedir
In English Language Mutable means "can change" and immutable means "cannot change". The term Immutable Object means that the state of the Object cannot change after its creation. An immutable type sets the property or state of the object as read only because it cannot be modified after it is assigned during initialization.
Is String in .Net immutable ?
Yes, the String in .Net is immutable. The System.String class is an immutable type provided in the .NET framework class library. Since a String is an immutable type, it cannot be modified. When you modify a string you are actually creating a new string object with the desired value.
e.g.
 
The above code will create 1000 new string variables in the memory.

DataSet (GITHUB)  (örnek)
dataset nedir
DataSet. This is a collection of DataTables. We use the DataSet type to store many DataTables in a single collection. Conceptually, the DataSet acts as a set of DataTable instances.
Usage. DataSet simplifies programs that use many DataTables. To effectively use the DataSet, you will need to have some DataTables handy. We begin by creating some.
Create. In this program, we create two DataTables. One stores two rows of patient information. And the second stores two rows of medication information.
Next: We create a DataSet with the DataSet constructor. Then we add the two DataTables to the DataSet instance. Finally we print the XML.


public ActionResult Index()
        {
            // Çalıştırabilmek için Controller adını "Home" olarak değiştirmek gerekebilir (gerekmeyedebilir).

Dapper, ADO.NET - EF hız karşılaştırma
There's no doubt that Entity Framework with LINQ is great (I've certainly written enough articles about it). But Entity Framework comes at a cost. As Matthew Jones points out on his blog, using LINQ+Entity Framework adds time to each data retrieval compared to using ADO.NET's SqlDataAdapter. The cost is small (anywhere from a third of a millisecond to 100 milliseconds) but it's not zero, either.
If speed is important to you but you don't want to give up object-oriented data access, then you can consider using Dapper. Like Entity Framework, Dapper is an Object Relation Mapper that allows you to issue queries against a relational database and get back objects. What's attractive about Dapper, compared to Entity Framework, is that its response times are equivalent to using pure ADO.NET.

Base keyword      (GITHUB)  (örnek)
Base nedir, base keyword nedir
The base keyword is used to access members of the base class from within a derived class:
•	Call a method on the base class that has been overridden by another method.
•	Specify which base-class constructor should be called when creating instances of the derived class.
A base class access is permitted only in a constructor, an instance method, or an instance property accessor.
It is an error to use the base keyword from within a static method.
The base class that is accessed is the base class specified in the class declaration. For example, if you specify class ClassB : ClassA, the members of ClassA are accessed from ClassB, regardless of the base class of ClassA.

abstract	    (GITHUB)  (örnek)
abstract nedir
The abstract modifier indicates that the thing being modified has a missing or incomplete implementation. The abstract modifier can be used with classes, methods, properties, indexers, and events. Use the abstract modifier in a class declaration to indicate that a class is intended only to be a base class of other classes, not instantiated on its own. Members marked as abstract must be implemented by non-abstract classes that derive from the abstract class.
Example
In this example, the class Square must provide an implementation of GetArea because it derives from Shape:
C#Copy
abstract class Shape
{
    public abstract int GetArea();
}

class Square : Shape
{
    int side;

    public Square(int n) => side = n;

    // GetArea method is required to avoid a compile-time error.
    public override int GetArea() => side * side;

    static void Main()
    {
        var sq = new Square(12);
        Console.WriteLine($"Area of the square = {sq.GetArea()}");
    }
}
// Output: Area of the square = 144
Abstract classes have the following features:
•	An abstract class cannot be instantiated.
•	An abstract class may contain abstract methods and accessors.
•	It is not possible to modify an abstract class with the sealed modifier because the two modifiers have opposite meanings. The sealed modifier prevents a class from being inherited and the abstract modifier requires a class to be inherited.

Abstract data type 	(GITHUB) (örnek)
Abstract data type nedir
Abstract Data type (ADT) is a type (or class) for objects whose behaviour is defined by a set of value and a set of operations.
The definition of ADT only mentions what operations are to be performed but not how these operations will be implemented. It does not specify how data will be organized in memory and what algorithms will be used for implementing the operations. It is called “abstract” because it gives an implementation-independent view. The process of providing only the essentials and hiding the details is known as abstraction.
 
The user of data type does not need to know how that data type is implemented, for example, we have been using Primitive values like int, float, char data types only with the knowledge that these data type can operate and be performed on without any idea of how they are implemented. So a user only needs to know what a data type can do, but not how it will be implemented. Think of ADT as a black box which hides the inner structure and design of the data type. Now we’ll define three ADTs namely List ADT, Stack ADT, Queue ADT.
1.	List ADT
•	The data is generally stored in key sequence in a list which has a head structure consisting of count, pointers and address of compare function needed to compare the data in the list.
 


•	The data node contains the pointer to a data structure and a self-referential pointer which points to the next node in the list.
filter_none
brightness_4
//List ADT Type Definitions 
typedef struct node 
{ 
 void *DataPtr; 
 struct node *link; 
} Node; 
typedef struct
{ 
 int count; 
 Node *pos; 
 Node *head; 
 Node *rear; 
 int (*compare) (void *argument1, void *argument2) 
} LIST;  
•	The List ADT Functions is given below:
 
A list contains elements of the same type arranged in sequential order and following operations can be performed on the list.
•	get() – Return an element from the list at any given position.
•	insert() – Insert an element at any position of the list.
•	remove() – Remove the first occurrence of any element from a non-empty list.
•	removeAt() – Remove the element at a specified location from a non-empty list.
•	replace() – Replace an element at any position by another element.
•	size() – Return the number of elements in the list.
•	isEmpty() – Return true if the list is empty, otherwise return false.
•	isFull() – Return true if the list is full, otherwise return false.
2.	Stack ADT
•	In Stack ADT Implementation instead of data being stored in each node, the pointer to data is stored.
•	The program allocates memory for the data and address is passed to the stack ADT.
 
•	The head node and the data nodes are encapsulated in the ADT. The calling function can only see the pointer to the stack.
•	The stack head structure also contains a pointer to top and count of number of entries currently in stack.

brightness_4
//Stack ADT Type Definitions 
typedef struct node 
{ 
 void *DataPtr; 
 struct node *link; 
} StackNode; 
typedef struct
{ 
 int count; 
 StackNode *top; 
} STACK; 
A Stack contains elements of the same type arranged in sequential order. All operations take place at a single end that is top of the stack and following operations can be performed:
•	push() – Insert an element at one end of the stack called top.
•	pop() – Remove and return the element at the top of the stack, if it is not empty.
•	peek() – Return the element at the top of the stack without removing it, if the stack is not empty.
•	size() – Return the number of elements in the stack.
•	isEmpty() – Return true if the stack is empty, otherwise return false.
•	isFull() – Return true if the stack is full, otherwise return false.
3.	Queue ADT
•	The queue abstract data type (ADT) follows the basic design of the stack abstract data type.
 
•	Each node contains a void pointer to the data and the link pointer to the next element in the queue. The program’s responsibility is to allocate memory for storing the data.


//Queue ADT Type Definitions 
typedef struct node 
{ 
 void *DataPtr; 
 struct node *next; 
} QueueNode; 
typedef struct 
{ 
 QueueNode *front; 
 QueueNode *rear; 
 int count; 
} QUEUE; 
A Queue contains elements of the same type arranged in sequential order. Operations take place at both ends, insertion is done at the end and deletion is done at the front. Following operations can be performed:
•	enqueue() – Insert an element at the end of the queue.
•	dequeue() – Remove and return the first element of the queue, if the queue is not empty.
•	peek() – Return the element of the queue without removing it, if the queue is not empty.
•	size() – Return the number of elements in the queue.
•	isEmpty() – Return true if the queue is empty, otherwise return false.
•	isFull() – Return true if the queue is full, otherwise return false.
From these definitions, we can clearly see that the definitions do not specify how these ADTs will be represented and how the operations will be carried out. There can be different ways to implement an ADT, for example, the List ADT can be implemented using arrays, or singly linked list or doubly linked list. Similarly, stack ADT and Queue ADT can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.

Dependency injection (services) in ASP.NET CORE
ASP.NET Core has a built-in dependency injection (DI) framework that makes configured services available to an app's classes. One way to get an instance of a service in a class is to create a constructor with a parameter of the required type. The parameter can be the service type or an interface. The DI system provides the service at runtime.
Here's a class that uses DI to get an Entity Framework Core context object.

Apache Subversion / Subversion (eski adı)
apache subversion nedir, subversion nedir

SVN: Subversion bir sürüm takip sistemidir. Kısaca SVN olarak da adlandırılmaktadır.
Ortak bir depoda sürümlenmiş şekilde saklanan proje dosyalarını geliştiriceler kendilerine tanımlanmış kullanıcı adı ile çekebilirler. Kendi depolama alanına çekilen bu dosyalar üzerinde işlemler yapıp tekrar ortak depoya gönderebilirle


Yazılım geliştirmede Apache Subversion (eski adıyla Subversion[1], 2000 yılında CollabNet firması tarafından başlatılan ve desteklenen bir sürüm kontrol sistemidir. Yazılım geliştiricileri Subversion'ı kaynak kodu, ağ sayfaları veya belgelendirme gibi dosyaların güncel ve geçmiş tüm değişikliklerini tutmak için kullanırlar. Amacı yaygın olarak kullanılan Concurrent Versions System (CVS)'in olabildiğince uyumlu bir ardılı olmaktır.
Açık kaynak topluluğu Subversion'ı yaygın olarak kullanmıştır: örneğin Apache Software Foundation projelerinde, Free Pascal, FreeBSD, GCC, Django, Ruby, Mono, SourceForge, ExtJS, Tigris.org, PHP ve MediaWiki. Google Code açık kaynak proje barındırmalarında Subversion desteği de vermektedir. CodePlex diğer istemcilere olduğu kadar Subversion erişimi de sağlamaktadır.
İş dünyası da Subversion kullanımı kabul etmeye başlamıştır. Forrester Research tarafından 2007 yılında hazırlanan bir rapora göre Tekbaşına Yazılım Konfigürasyonu Yönetimi (SCM) kategorisinde Subversion'ı lider ve Yazılım Konfigürasyonu ve Değişiklik Yönetimi (SCCM) alanında da güçlü bir oyuncu gösterilmiştir.[2]
Subversion Apache Lisansını kullanmaktadır ve açık kaynak kodludur.

Single Page Application 
Single web application nedir
Ajax yollama json dönme sayfanın tamamen yenilenmeden içeriğinin değişmesi olayının teknik anlatımı.. Bir örnek üzerinden anlatılıyor:
The app uses a single-page application (SPA) design. "Single-page application" is the general term for a web application that loads a single HTML page and then updates the page dynamically, instead of loading new pages. After the initial page load, the app talks with the server through AJAX requests. The AJAX requests return JSON data, which the app uses to update the UI.

AJAX isn't new, but today there are JavaScript frameworks that make it easier to build and maintain a large sophisticated SPA application. This tutorial uses Knockout.js, but you can use any JavaScript client framework.

Here are the main building blocks for this app:

ASP.NET MVC creates the HTML page.
ASP.NET Web API handles the AJAX requests and returns JSON data.
Knockout.js data-binds the HTML elements to the JSON data.
Entity Framework talks to the database.

XHTML     (GITHUB) (örnek)
What Is XHTML?
XHTML stands for EXtensible HyperText Markup Language
XHTML is almost identical to HTML
XHTML is stricter than HTML
XHTML is HTML defined as an XML application
XHTML is supported by all major browsers 
Why XHTML?
Many pages on the internet contain "bad" HTML.
This HTML code works fine in most browsers (even if it does not follow the HTML rules):
<html>
<head>
  <title>This is bad HTML</title>

<body>
  <h1>Bad HTML
  <p>This is a paragraph
</body>

Today's market consists of different browser technologies. Some browsers run on computers, and some browsers run on mobile phones or other small devices. Smaller devices often lack the resources or power to interpret "bad" markup.
XML is a markup language where documents must be marked up correctly (be "well-formed").
XHTML was developed by combining the strengths of HTML and XML.
XHTML is HTML redesigned as XML.

The Most Important Differences from HTML:
Document Structure:
XHTML DOCTYPE is mandatory
The xmlns attribute in <html> is mandatory
<html>, <head>, <title>, and <body> are mandatory
XHTML Elements:
XHTML elements must be properly nested
XHTML elements must always be closed
XHTML elements must be in lowercase
XHTML documents must have one root element
XHTML Attributes:
Attribute names must be in lower case
Attribute values must be quoted
Attribute minimization is forbidden
<!DOCTYPE ....> Is Mandatory
An XHTML document must have an XHTML DOCTYPE declaration.
A complete list of all the XHTML Doctypes is found in our HTML Tags Reference.
The <html>, <head>, <title>, and <body> elements must also be present, and the xmlns attribute in <html> must specify the xml namespace for the document.
This example shows an XHTML document with a minimum of required tags:
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

<head>
  <title>Title of document</title>
</head>

<body>
  some content
</body>

</html>

XHTML Elements Must Be Properly Nested
In HTML, some elements can be improperly nested within each other, like this:
<b><i>This text is bold and italic</b></i>
In XHTML, all elements must be properly nested within each other, like this:
<b><i>This text is bold and italic</i></b>
________________________________________
XHTML Elements Must Always Be Closed
This is wrong:
<p>This is a paragraph
<p>This is another paragraph
This is correct:
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
<p>This is another paragraph</p>
________________________________________
Empty Elements Must Also Be Closed
This is wrong:
A break: <br>
A horizontal rule: <hr>
An image: <img src="happy.gif" alt="Happy face">
This is correct:
A break: <br />
A horizontal rule: <hr />
An image: <img src="happy.gif" alt="Happy face" />
________________________________________
XHTML Elements Must Be In Lower Case
This is wrong:
<BODY>
<P>This is a paragraph</P>
</BODY>
This is correct:
<body>
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
</body>
________________________________________
XHTML Attribute Names Must Be In Lower Case
This is wrong:
<table WIDTH="100%">
This is correct:
<table width="100%">

Attribute Values Must Be Quoted
This is wrong:
<table width=100%>
This is correct:
<table width="100%">
________________________________________
Attribute Minimization Is Forbidden
Wrong:
<input type="checkbox" name="vehicle" value="car" checked />
Correct:
<input type="checkbox" name="vehicle" value="car" checked="checked" />
Wrong:
<input type="text" name="lastname" disabled />
Correct:
<input type="text" name="lastname" disabled="disabled" />
________________________________________
How to Convert from HTML to XHTML
1.	Add an XHTML <!DOCTYPE> to the first line of every page
2.	Add an xmlns attribute to the html element of every page
3.	Change all element names to lowercase
4.	Close all empty elements
5.	Change all attribute names to lowercase

RESTful API  
(representational state transfer)    	(GITHUB) (örnek)
Restful api nedir?

A RESTful API is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data.
A RESTful API -- also referred to as a RESTful web service -- is based on representational state transfer (REST) technology, an architectural style and approach to communications often used in web services development.
REST technology is generally preferred to the more robust Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) technology because REST leverages less bandwidth, making it more suitable for internet usage. An API for a website is code that allows two software programs to communicate with each another . The API spells out the proper way for a developer to write a program requesting services from an operating system or other application.

UX (User Experience) 	(GITHUB) 	(örnek)
UI ve UX çoğu kez beraber kullanılmalarına rağmen aslında çok farklı iki alandır. UI konusunda olmasa bile UX konusunda çok geride olan ülkemizde, maalesef bu işi profesyonel olarak yapan insanlar bile aralarındaki farkı çok bilmiyorlar. Ülkemizde bir UXD (User Interface Designer) ile tanışmanız çok zor. Türkiye’de bu işle ilgili çoğu insanın özgeçmişinde “UI/UX” yazar. Bunun bir sebebi aralarındaki farkın bilinmemesi, diğer sebebi ise internet sektörünü geriden takip etmemizden dolayı bu işi iki parçaya bölmenin bir lüks olarak görünmesidir.

UI ve UX arasındaki farklar nelerdir ?
The UI is often talked about in conjunction with user experience (UX), which may include the aesthetic appearance of the device, response time and the content that is presented to the user within the context of the user interface. Both terms fall under the concept of human-computer interaction (HCI), which is the field of study focusing on the creation of computer technology and the interaction between humans and all forms of IT design. Specifically, HCI studies areas such as UCD, UI design and UX design.
An increasing focus on creating an optimized user experience has led some to carve out careers as UI and UX experts. Certain languages, such as HTML and CSS, have been geared toward making it easier to create a strong user interface and experience.

UI ingilizce User Interface'in (kullanıcı arayüzü) kısaltılmış hali, UX ise ingilizce User Experience'in (kullanıcı deneyimi) kısaltılmış halidir. UX, içinde UI'i de içeren bir çok disiplini de içeren daha büyük bir halkadır, yani UX > UI diyebiliriz. UX, bir kullanıcının ilgili şeyi (ürünü, hizmeti, web sitesini...) kullanırken, tasarım, kolay kullanım, kolay anlama, kullanırken memnun kalma gibi daha geniş bir perspektifte değerlendirir. UI ise bu deneyimin tasarım kısmını ifade eder. 
UI ve UX arasındaki farkı basit bir örnekle anlatalım. UX bir binanın tasarımını yapan mimar gibidir. Oda yerleşimleri ve büyüklükleri nasıl olacak, hangi malzemeler kullanılacak, ışıklandırma ve renkler nasıl olacak tüm bunları hesaplar, planlar... Tüm planlanan işlerin yapılması ise UI'dir. Görüldüğü gibi UX birden fazla disiplini içinde barındıran, daha çok planlamayı içeren ancak alt disiplinlerle ilgili  yeterli derecede bilgiyi barındıran, daha çok soyut bir çıktı veren bir alandır. UI ise, somut bir çıktı veren bir alandır. UI bir kahveyi içmek için gereken bardağı tasarlamış, UX ise buna ek olarak kahveyi içenin elinin yanmaması için bir bardak daha eklemiş. UX, UI'den farklı olarak kullanıcının ilgili ürünü kullanırken karşılaşabileceği problemleri de düşünür ve bunlarada çözümler bulur.

Web Indexing		(GITHUB) 	(örnek)
web indexing nedir, web Indexing nedir
Web indexing, or internet indexing, comprises methods for indexing the contents of a website or of the Internet as a whole. Individual websites or intranets may use a back-of-the-book index, while search engines usually use keywords and metadata to provide a more useful vocabulary for Internet or onsite searching. With the increase in the number of periodicals that have articles online, web indexing is also becoming important for periodical websites.[1]
Back-of-the-book-style web indexes may be called "web site A-Z indexes".[2] The implication with "A-Z" is that there is an alphabetical browse view or interface. This interface differs from that of a browse through layers of hierarchical categories (also known as a taxonomy) which are not necessarily alphabetical, but are also found on some web sites. Although an A-Z index could be used to index multiple sites, rather than the multiple pages of a single site, this is unusual.
Metadata web indexing involves assigning keywords or phrases to web pages or web sites within a metadata tag (or "meta-tag") field, so that the web page or web site can be retrieved with a search engine that is customized to search the keywords field.[2] This may or may not involve using keywords restricted to a controlled vocabulary list. This method is commonly used by search engine indexing.

Web Crawler		(GITHUB) 	(örnek)
crawler nedir, web crawler nedir, webcrawler nedir
A Web crawler, sometimes called a spider or spiderbot and often shortened to crawler, is an Internet bot that systematically browses the World Wide Web, typically for the purpose of Web indexing (web spidering).
Web search engines and some other sites use Web crawling or spidering software to update their web content or indices of others sites' web content. Web crawlers copy pages for processing by a search engine which indexes the downloaded pages so users can search more efficiently.
Crawlers consume resources on visited systems and often visit sites without approval. Issues of schedule, load, and "politeness" come into play when large collections of pages are accessed. Mechanisms exist for public sites not wishing to be crawled to make this known to the crawling agent. For example, including a robots.txt file can request bots to index only parts of a website, or nothing at all.

JPA / Java Persistence API   	(GITHUB) 	(örnek)
The Java ORM standard for storing, accessing, and managing Java objects in a relational database.
As a specification, the Java Persistence API is concerned with persistence, which loosely means any mechanism by which Java objects outlive the application process that created them. Not all Java objects need to be persisted, but most applications persist key business objects. The JPA specification lets you define which objects should be persisted, and how those objects should be persisted in your Java applications.
By itself, JPA is not a tool or framework; rather, it defines a set of concepts that can be implemented by any tool or framework. While JPA's object-relational mapping (ORM) model was originally based on Hibernate, it has since evolved. Likewise, while JPA was originally intended for use with relational/SQL databases, some JPA implementations have been extended for use with NoSQL datastores. A popular framework that supports JPA with NoSQL is EclipseLink, the reference implementation for JPA 2.2.
JPA 2.2 in Jakarta EE
The Java Persistence API was first released as a subset of the EJB 3.0 specification (JSR 220) in Java EE 5. It has since evolved as its own spec, starting with the release of JPA 2.0 in Java EE 6 (JSR 317). As of this writing, JPA 2.2 has been adopted for continuation as part of Jakarta EE.
JPA and Hibernate
Because of their intertwined history, Hibernate and JPA are frequently conflated. However, like the Java Servlet specification, JPA has spawned many compatible tools and frameworks; Hibernate is just one of them.

What is Java ORM?
While they differ in execution, every JPA implementation provides some kind of ORM layer. In order to understand JPA and JPA-compatible tools, you need to have a good grasp on ORM.
Object-relational mapping is a task–one that developers have good reason to avoid doing manually. A framework like Hibernate ORM or EclipseLink codifies that task into a library or framework, an ORM layer. As part of the application architecture, the ORM layer is responsible for managing the conversion of software objects to interact with the tables and columns in a relational database. In Java, the ORM layer converts Java classes and objects so that they can be stored and managed in a relational database.
[ Learn Java from beginning concepts to advanced design patterns in this comprehensive 12-part course! ]
By default, the name of the object being persisted becomes the name of the table, and fields become columns. Once the table is set up, each table row corresponds to an object in the application. Object mapping is configurable, but defaults tend to work well.
JPA with NoSQL
Until fairly recently, non-relational databases were uncommon curiosities. The NoSQL movement changed all that, and now a variety of NoSQL databases are available to Java developers. Some JPA implementations have evolved to embrace NoSQL, including Hibernate OGM and EclipseLink.

JSF / JavaServer Faces
java server faces nedir, jsf nedir, javaserver faces nedir, javaserverfaces nedir
JavaServer Faces (JSF) is the Java standard technology for building component-based, event-oriented web interfaces. Like JavaServer Pages (JSP), JSF allows access to server-side data and logic. Unlike JSP, which is essentially an HTML page imbued with server-side capabilities, JSF is an XML document that represents formal components in a logical tree. JSF components are backed by Java objects, which are independent of the HTML and have the full range of Java abilities, including accessing remote APIs and databases.
The key idea to a framework like JSF is to encapsulate (or wrap) client-side technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing developers to build web interfaces without much interaction with these technologies.
This article presents a snapshot of JSF's approach to component-based UI development for Java web applications. Simple examples introduce JSF's MVC architecture, event model, and component library. Examples include new features in JSF 2.3, and we'll use PrimeFaces for our component library.

-JSP / JavaServer Pages 	(GITHUB) 	(örnek)
jsp nedir java server pages nedir, javaserver pages nedir, javaserverpages nedir
JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a Java standard technology that enables you to write dynamic, data-driven pages for your Java web applications. JSP is built on top of the Java Servlet specification. The two technologies typically work together, especially in older Java web applications. From a coding perspective, the most obvious difference between them is that with servlets you write Java code and then embed client-side markup (like HTML) into that code, whereas with JSP you start with the client-side script or markup, then embed JSP tags to connect your page to the Java backend.
JSP is also closely related to JSF (JavaServer Faces), a Java specification for building MVC (model-view-controller) web applications. JSP is a relatively simpler and older technology than JSF, which is the standard for Java web frameworks like Eclipse Mojarra, MyFaces, and PrimeFaces. While it is not uncommon to see JSP used as the frontend for older JSF applications, Facelets is the preferred view technology for modern JSF implementations.
While JSP may not be your first choice for building dynamic web pages, it is a core Java web technology. JSP pages are relatively quick and easy to build, and they interact seamlessly with Java servlets in a servlet container like Tomcat. You will encounter JSP in older Java web applications, and from time to time you may find it useful for building simple, dynamic Java web pages. As a Java developer, you should at least be familiar with JSP.
[ Also on InfoWorld: 10 best API management tools ]
This article will be a quick introduction to JavaServer Pages, including the JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL). Examples show you how to write a simple HTML page, embed JSP tags to connect to a Java servlet, and run the page in a servlet container.
See previous articles in this series to learn more about Java servlets and JavaServer Faces.
JSP in Jakarta EE
Following the release of Java EE 8, Oracle moved stewardship of Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) to the Eclipse Foundation. Going forward, the Java enterprise platform has been rebranded as Jakarta EE. Along with the Java Servlet and JSF specifications, JSP is one of the Java web technologies included for ongoing support and upgrades in Jakarta EE.

A servlet is a Java programming language class that is used to extend the capabilities of servers that host applications accessed by means of a request-response programming model. Although servlets can respond to any type of request, they are commonly used to extend the applications hosted by web servers. For such applications, Java Servlet technology defines HTTP-specific servlet classes.
Java servlet, Java EE'de Java Servlet API'siyle uyumlu bir Java (programlama) sınıfı olup HTTP istemlerine cevap vermek için kullanılır. Belirli bir istemci-sunucu protokolüne bağlı olmamasına rağmen genelde bu protokolle kullanılır. Servlet kelimesi genelde HTTP servlet yerine bu yüzden kullanılmaktadır.[1] Dolayısıyla bir yazılım uzmanı, Java platformu sayesinde servleti bir Web sunucusuna dinamik içerik eklemek için kullanabilir. Üretilen kod genelde HTML olsa da bazen XML de olabilir. Servletler, CGI ya da ASP.NET gibi Java-dışı Web içerik teknolojilerinin Java'daki karşıt üründür. Servletlerle HTTP çerezleri veya URL yeniden yazımı kullanılarak oturum değişkenlerinin sistem durumunu birçok sunucu hareketleri boyunca koruması sağlanmaktadır.

Apache Hive is a data warehouse software project built on top of Apache Hadoop for providing data query and analysis.[3] Hive gives an SQL-like interface to query data stored in various databases and file systems that integrate with Hadoop. Traditional SQL queries must be implemented in the MapReduce Java API to execute SQL applications and queries over distributed data. Hive provides the necessary SQL abstraction to integrate SQL-like queries (HiveQL) into the underlying Java without the need to implement queries in the low-level Java API. Since most data warehousing applications work with SQL-based querying languages, Hive aids portability of SQL-based applications to Hadoop.[4] While initially developed by Facebook, Apache Hive is used and developed by other companies such as Netflix and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).[5][6] Amazon maintains a software fork of Apache Hive included in Amazon Elastic MapReduce on Amazon Web Services.[7]

The language for this platform is called Pig Latin.[1] Pig can execute its Hadoop jobs in MapReduce, Apache Tez, or Apache Spark.[2] Pig Latin abstracts the programming from the Java MapReduce idiom into a notation which makes MapReduce programming high level, similar to that of SQL for relational database management systems. Pig Latin can be extended using user-defined functions (UDFs) which the user can write in Java, Python, JavaScript, Ruby or Groovy[3] and then call directly from the language.

apache spark nedir, spark nedir
Apache Spark is an open-source distributed general-purpose cluster-computing framework. Spark provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance. Originally developed at the University of California, Berkeley's AMPLab, the Spark codebase was later donated to the Apache Software Foundation, which has maintained it since.

Overview
Apache Spark has its architectural foundation in the Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD), a read-only multiset of data items distributed over a cluster of machines, that is maintained in a fault-tolerant way.[2] The Dataframe API was released as an abstraction on top of the RDD, followed by the Dataset API. In Spark 1.x, the RDD was the primary application programming interface (API), but as of Spark 2.x use of the Dataset API is encouraged[3] even though the RDD API is not deprecated.[4][5] The RDD technology still underlies the Dataset API.[6][7]
Spark and its RDDs were developed in 2012 in response to limitations in the MapReduce cluster computing paradigm, which forces a particular linear dataflow structure on distributed programs: MapReduce programs read input data from disk, map a function across the data, reduce the results of the map, and store reduction results on disk. Spark's RDDs function as a working set for distributed programs that offers a (deliberately) restricted form of distributed shared memory.[8]

apache Impala nedir, apache impala nedir, impala nedir
What is Impala?
Impala is a MPP (Massive Parallel Processing) SQL query engine for processing huge volumes of data that is stored in Hadoop cluster. It is an open source software which is written in C++ and Java. It provides high performance and low latency compared to other SQL engines for Hadoop.
In other words, Impala is the highest performing SQL engine (giving RDBMS-like experience) which provides the fastest way to access data that is stored in Hadoop Distributed File System.
Why Impala?
Impala combines the SQL support and multi-user performance of a traditional analytic database with the scalability and flexibility of Apache Hadoop, by utilizing standard components such as HDFS, HBase, Metastore, YARN, and Sentry.
•	With Impala, users can communicate with HDFS or HBase using SQL queries in a faster way compared to other SQL engines like Hive.
•	Impala can read almost all the file formats such as Parquet, Avro, RCFile used by Hadoop.
Impala uses the same metadata, SQL syntax (Hive SQL), ODBC driver, and user interface (Hue Beeswax) as Apache Hive, providing a familiar and unified platform for batch-oriented or real-time queries.
Unlike Apache Hive, Impala is not based on MapReduce algorithms. It implements a distributed architecture based on daemon processes that are responsible for all the aspects of query execution that run on the same machines.
Thus, it reduces the latency of utilizing MapReduce and this makes Impala faster than Apache Hive.

Advantages of Impala
Here is a list of some noted advantages of Cloudera Impala.
•	Using impala, you can process data that is stored in HDFS at lightning-fast speed with traditional SQL knowledge.
•	Since the data processing is carried where the data resides (on Hadoop cluster), data transformation and data movement is not required for data stored on Hadoop, while working with Impala.
•	Using Impala, you can access the data that is stored in HDFS, HBase, and Amazon s3 without the knowledge of Java (MapReduce jobs). You can access them with a basic idea of SQL queries.
•	To write queries in business tools, the data has to be gone through a complicated extract-transform-load (ETL) cycle. But, with Impala, this procedure is shortened. The time-consuming stages of loading & reorganizing is overcome with the new techniques such as exploratory data analysis & data discovery making the process faster.
•	Impala is pioneering the use of the Parquet file format, a columnar storage layout that is optimized for large-scale queries typical in data warehouse scenarios.
Features of Impala
Given below are the features of cloudera Impala −
•	Impala is available freely as open source under the Apache license.
•	Impala supports in-memory data processing, i.e., it accesses/analyzes data that is stored on Hadoop data nodes without data movement.
•	You can access data using Impala using SQL-like queries.
•	Impala provides faster access for the data in HDFS when compared to other SQL engines.
•	Using Impala, you can store data in storage systems like HDFS, Apache HBase, and Amazon s3.
•	You can integrate Impala with business intelligence tools like Tableau, Pentaho, Micro strategy, and Zoom data.
•	Impala supports various file formats such as, LZO, Sequence File, Avro, RCFile, and Parquet.
•	Impala uses metadata, ODBC driver, and SQL syntax from Apache Hive.

The Internet of things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.[1][2][3][4]
The definition of the Internet of things has evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, real-time analytics, machine learning, commodity sensors, and embedded systems.[1] Traditional fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, control systems, automation (including home and building automation), and others all contribute to enabling the Internet of things. In the consumer market, IoT technology is most synonymous with products pertaining to the concept of the "smart home", including devices and appliances (such as lighting fixtures, thermostats, home security systems and cameras, and other home appliances) that support one or more common ecosystems, and can be controlled via devices associated with that ecosystem, such as smartphones and smart speakers.
There are a number of serious concerns about dangers in the growth of IoT, especially in the areas of privacy and security, and consequently industry and governmental moves to address these concerns have begun.

M2M nedir, machine to machine nedir, machine 2 machine nedir

Machine to machine (M2M) is direct communication between devices using any communications channel, including wired and wireless.[1][2] Machine to machine communication can include industrial instrumentation, enabling a sensor or meter to communicate the information it records (such as temperature, inventory level, etc.) to application software that can use it (for example, adjusting an industrial process based on temperature or placing orders to replenish inventory).[3] Such communication was originally accomplished by having a remote network of machines relay information back to a central hub for analysis, which would then be rerouted into a system like a personal computer.[4]
More recent machine to machine communication has changed into a system of networks that transmits data to personal appliances. The expansion of IP networks around the world has made machine to machine communication quicker and easier while using less power.[5] These networks also allow new business opportunities for consumers and suppliers.[6]
History
Wired communication machines have been using signaling to exchange information since the early 20th century. Machine to machine has taken more sophisticated forms since the advent of computer networking automation[7] and predates cellular communication. It has been utilized in applications such as telemetry, industrial, automation, and SCADA.

Full Text Search / Full-text search   	(GITHUB) 	(örnek)
Full Text Search nedir, Full-text search nedir

A full-text database is a compilation of documents in which the complete text of each referenced document is available for online viewing, printing, or downloading. In addition to text documents, images are often included, such as graphs, maps, photos, and diagrams.



In text retrieval, full-text search refers to techniques for searching a single computer-stored document or a collection in a full-text database. Full-text search is distinguished from searches based on metadata or on parts of the original texts represented in databases (such as titles, abstracts, selected sections, or bibliographical references).
In a full-text search, a search engine examines all of the words in every stored document as it tries to match search criteria (for example, text specified by a user). Full-text-searching techniques became common in online bibliographic databases in the 1990s.[verification needed] Many websites and application programs (such as word processing software) provide full-text-search capabilities. Some web search engines, such as AltaVista, employ full-text-search techniques, while others index only a portion of the web pages examined by their indexing systems.[1]

Indexing
When dealing with a small number of documents, it is possible for the full-text-search engine to directly scan the contents of the documents with each query, a strategy called "serial scanning". This is what some tools, such as grep, do when searching.
However, when the number of documents to search is potentially large, or the quantity of search queries to perform is substantial, the problem of full-text search is often divided into two tasks: indexing and searching. The indexing stage will scan the text of all the documents and build a list of search terms (often called an index, but more correctly named a concordance). In the search stage, when performing a specific query, only the index is referenced, rather than the text of the original documents.[2]
The indexer will make an entry in the index for each term or word found in a document, and possibly note its relative position within the document. Usually the indexer will ignore stop words (such as "the" and "and") that are both common and insufficiently meaningful to be useful in searching. Some indexers also employ language-specific stemming on the words being indexed. For example, the words "drives", "drove", and "driven" will be recorded in the index under the single concept word "drive".

full-text database nedir, full text database nedir, complete-text database nedir, complete text database nedir

A full-text database or a complete-text database is a database that contains the complete text of books, dissertations, journals, magazines, newspapers or other kinds of textual documents. They differ from bibliographic databases (which contain only bibliographical metadata, including abstracts in some cases) and non-bibliographic databases (such as directories and numeric databases).
One of the earliest systems was IBM STAIRS, introduced in 1973.
Full-text databases became common about 1990 when computer storage technology made them economic and technologically possible. There are two main classes: an extension of the classical bibliographical databases into full-text databases (e.g. on hosts such as BRS, Dialog, LexisNexis and Westlaw) and Internet-based full-text databases (based on search engines or XML).

Bibliographic database  		(GITHUB) 	(örnek)
Bibliographic database nedir

A bibliographic database is a database of bibliographic records, an organized digital collection of references to published literature, including journal and newspaper articles, conference proceedings, reports, government and legal publications, patents, books, etc. In contrast to library catalogue entries, a large proportion of the bibliographic records in bibliographic databases describe articles, conference papers, etc., rather than complete monographs, and they generally contain very rich subject descriptions in the form of keywords, subject classification terms, or abstracts.[1]
A bibliographic database may be general in scope or cover a specific academic discipline like computer science.[2] A significant number of bibliographic databases are proprietary, available by licensing agreement from vendors, or directly from the indexing and abstracting services that create them.[3]
Many bibliographic databases have evolved into digital libraries, providing the full text of the indexed contents:[citation needed] for instance CORE also mirrors and indexes the full text of scholarly articles and Our Research develops a search engine for open access content found by Unpaywall.[4] Others converge with non-bibliographic scholarly databases to create more complete disciplinary search engine systems, such as Chemical Abstracts or Entrez.

Intermediate language	(GITHUB) (örnek)
Intermediate language nedir
An intermediate language is an abstract programming language used by a compiler as an in-between step when translating a computer program into machine code. Before compiling the program into code for an actual, physical machine, the compiler first translates it into intermediate code suitable for a theoretical, abstract machine. This code is analyzed, and if any opportunities for optimization are identified, the compiler can perform them when performing the translation into assembly language.

Fields, Properties			(GITHUB)
Field nedir Property nedir

süper örnek
Properties expose fields. Fields should (almost always) be kept private to a class and accessed via get and set properties. 
Properties provide a level of abstraction allowing you to change the fields while not affecting the external way they are accessed by the things that use your class.

public class MyClass
{

    // this is a field.  It is private to your class and stores the actual data.
    private string _myField;

    // this is a property. When accessed it uses the underlying field,
    // but only exposes the contract, which will not be affected by the underlying field
    public string MyProperty
    {
        get
        {
            return _myField;
        }
        set
        {
            _myField = value;
        }
    }

    // This is an AutoProperty (C# 3.0 and higher) - which is a shorthand syntax
    // used to generate a private field for you
    public int AnotherProperty{get;set;} 
}

Fields are ordinary member variables or member instances of a class. Properties are an abstraction to get and set their values. Properties are also called accessors because they offer a way to change and retrieve a field if you expose a field in the class as private. Generally, you should declare your member variables private, then declare or define properties for them.

Birisi anlatmış:
Nesneye yönelik programlamanın üç temel ilkesinden biri olan sarmalamayı (encapsulation) uygularken kullanılıyoruz.

Sarmalama ilkesinde, bir sınıf tanımlaması içindeki değerleri tutan asıl değişkenlere (field) doğrudan erişimi engelleriz. Bu değişkenlere değer atamak için özelliklerden (property) yararlanırız. 

Bu değişkenlere değer atarken veya değerini istediklerinde tanımladığımız özellik bloğu otomatik olarak çalıştırılır. Biz de bu bloğun içinde değerleri test eder ve ondan sonra göndeririz veya değiştiririz.

Sınıfı kullanan kişi özelliklere doğrudan erişebilir. Alanlara doğrudan erişemez, erişmemelidir. Aksi halde istenmeyen değerleri bilerek veya yanlışlıkla atayarak sınıfımızın hatalı çalışmasına neden olabilirler.

1.	public class Deneme
2.	{
3.	    // Bu bir alan (field). Asıl genişlik değeri bunda saklanacak. 
4.	    private int genislik;
5.	 
6.	    // Bu (Genislik) bir özellik (property). Sınıfı kullanan bunu değiştirmek istediğinde
7.	    // set ile tanımlanan blok, bunun değerini istediğinde get ile tanımlanan
8.	    // blok otomatik çalıştırılır.
9.		
10.	    public int Genislik
11.	    {
12.		// Genislik özelliğinin değerini istediğinde...
13.	        get
14.	        {
15.		    // ... genislik alanının değerini gönder.
16.	            return genislik; 
17.	        }
18.		// Genislik özelliğinin değerini değiştirmek istediğinde...
19.	        set
20.	        {
21.		    // ... gelen değeri (value ile gelir) genislik alanına ata.
22.	            genislik = value;
23.	        }
24.	    }
25.	}

Tabi bu örnekte kontrol kısmı (ki asıl önemli konudur) yok. Sade olsun diye eklenmedi. Aşağıdakinde ise kontrol ediyoruz. Genellikle değer gönderirken (get bloğunda) varsa değer göndermeden önce yapılacak işler, testler veya ayarlamalar yapılır. Tabi varsa.

Asıl önemli olan set bölümü. Bu bölümde value ile gelen değeri kontrol ederiz ve eğer değer uygun ise alana atarız. Aksi halde bir hata fırlatırız veya varsayılan bir değeri atarız. Tabi değer atamadan önce veya sonra başka yapılacak işlemler de varsa onları da yapabiliriz.

1.	public class Deneme
2.	{
3.	    private int genislik;
4.	 
5.	    public int Genislik
6.	    {
7.	        get
8.	        {
9.	            return genislik; 
10.	        }
11.	        set
12.	        {
13.	            if (value <= 0)
14.	                throw new Exception("Deneme'nin genişliği 0'dan büyük bir değer olmalı.");
15.	            genislik = value;
16.	        }
17.	    }
18.	}
Örnekte set bölümünde gelen değer (value) 0 veya daha küçük ise bir hata fırlatıyoruz. Tabi varsayılan bir değer le de değiştirilebilir.

Peki kullanırken neler oluyor?

Örnek bir kullanım ve etkileri şöyle:

1.	Deneme d = new Deneme();
2.	d.Genislik = 10; // set bölümü çalışır ve value'nin değeri 10 olur.
3.	int gen = d.Genislik; // get bölümü çalıştırılır ve genislik alanının değeri gelir.
4.	d.Genislik = 0; // set bölümü çalışır, hata verir.

Nested Classes  		(GITHUB)	(read)
Nested class nedir, nested classes nedir, nested nedir
When one class is entirely dependent upon another, you may decide to implement it using a nested class. Nested classes are declared within the scope of an existing class and receive special benefits when they access their parent class's members.

What are Nested Classes?
A nested class is a special type of class that can be created using C#. Normally classes are declared within a namespace, or in the default namespace if one is not specified. A nested class is defined within the code block of another class, which itself may be a nested class to permit multiple nesting levels.

A nested class generally behaves is the same way as any other class. It can be instantiated separately to its parent class and is not instantiated automatically by its parent. However, there are some important differences. One key difference concerns the scope of the class. Normally classes can be either public or internal. A nested class may be declared as private, meaning that the class can only be seen by its parent class and other nested classes within that parent. A nested class may also be declared as protected, allowing it to also be accessed by classes that derive from its parent type. This may be extended to protected internal to allow other classes in the same assembly to access it.

Nested classes are given special access to instances of their parent classes. When an object of a parent class is passed to a method of a nested class, the method is permitted to access the private and protected members of the object. This makes nested classes ideal where a special relationship exists with the parent class that requires access to private members, particularly when the nested class is not required anywhere else and is never used in a standalone capability.

Example Nested Classes

We will start with a simple example of a nested class. In this case, the outer class will describe a sales order in an order-processing system. In this rather contrived design, there is no requirement for an order line to ever be created without an order. Furthermore, there is no need for an order line to be used externally to an order. In this case, it is useful to create an Order class with a nested, private OrderLine class.
NB: The following code uses .NET 3.0 syntax for brevity. For earlier versions of the .NET framework, you will need to expand the property declarations and possibly remove the use of generics.

class Order
{
    private List<OrderLine> _orderLines = new List<OrderLine>();
 
    public void AddOrderLine(string product, int quantity, double price)
    {
        OrderLine line = new OrderLine();
        line.ProductName = product;
        line.Quantity = quantity;
        line.Price = price;
        _orderLines.Add(line);
    }
 
    public double OrderTotal()
    {
        double total = 0;
        foreach (OrderLine line in _orderLines)
        {
            total += line.OrderLineTotal();
        }
        return total;
    }
 
    // Nested class
    private class OrderLine
    {
        public string ProductName { get; set; }
        public int Quantity { get; set; }
        public double Price { get; set; }
 
        public double OrderLineTotal()
        {
            return Price * Quantity;
        }
    }
}





The code above shows the simplified Order and nested OrderLine classes. The Order class has two public members. The first allows an item to be added to a private collection of order lines. The product name, price and quantity are passed to this method, which builds an OrderLine object and adds it to the list. The second method loops through each item in the collection and calculates the total value for the order.
The nested OrderLine class is used to represent order lines. It includes properties for the product name, quantity and price and a single method that calculates the total price for the order line. As the class is marked as private, it is invisible to all classes except its parent and any other nested classes that we may later create within Order. We could change the access modifier for the nested class to protected if we wished it to be visible to classes that inherit from Order.
We can test the order mechanism with the following code. This creates an order with two order lines and outputs the total value to the console:


Order order = new Order();
order.AddOrderLine("Cheese", 5, 1.99);
order.AddOrderLine("Oranges", 12, 0.35);
Console.WriteLine(order.OrderTotal());  // Outputs "14.15"

Increasing Nested Class Visibility
As our ordering system evolves, we may decide that it would be useful to permit other classes access to the nested OrderLine class. We could then modify the AddOrderLine method to accept an OrderLine object rather than its constituent parts. We can do this by changing the access modifier of the nested class to internal, protected internal or public, depending upon the requirements. The following code shows a new version of the code:

class Order
{
    private List<OrderLine> _orderLines = new List<OrderLine>();
 
    public void AddOrderLine(OrderLine line)
    {
        _orderLines.Add(line);
    }
 
    public double OrderTotal()
    {
        double total = 0;
        foreach (OrderLine line in _orderLines)
        {
            total += line.OrderLineTotal();
        }
        return total;
    }
 
    // Nested class
    internal class OrderLine
    {
        public string ProductName { get; set; }
        public int Quantity { get; set; }
        public double Price { get; set; }
 
        public double OrderLineTotal()
        {
            return Price * Quantity;
        }
    }
}


With the new versions of the classes, the code that creates an order will also be different. Rather than passing the product details as separate variables, the calling class will instantiate order lines and pass these to the AddOrderLine method. When instantiating a nested class, the name of the class must be qualified by prefixing it with the parent class's name, as in the following, updated example. Note that the order lines are created as Order.OrderLine objects.

Order order = new Order();
 
Order.OrderLine line1 = new Order.OrderLine(); //vaaay olaya gel

line1.ProductName = "Cheese";
line1.Quantity = 5;
line1.Price = 1.99;
order.AddOrderLine(line1);
 
Order.OrderLine line2 = new Order.OrderLine();
line2.ProductName = "Oranges";
line2.Quantity = 12;
line2.Price = 0.35;
order.AddOrderLine(line2);
 
Console.WriteLine(order.OrderTotal());


Accessing Private Members of the Parent Class
The final example will demonstrate the ability for nested classes to access private members of their parent classes. In this example, we have modified the order to include a discount multiplier. The multiplier is held as a private variable that may have been initialised using a constructor or a property. In this case the value is fixed at 0.85. Every order line value will be multiplied by this amount to give a 15% discount.
To allow the order lines to access the discount multiplier, the OrderLineTotal method has been updated to include a parameter. This parameter accepts an Order object. The method retrieves the private discount multiplier from the Order and includes it in the calculation, rounding the result to two decimal places on a line-by-line basis. If the OrderLine class was not nested within Order, this would not be possible.

class Order
{
    private List<OrderLine> _orderLines = new List<OrderLine>();
    private double DiscountMultiplier = 0.85;
 
    public void AddOrderLine(OrderLine line)
    {
        _orderLines.Add(line);
    }
 
    public double OrderTotal()
    {
        double total = 0;
        foreach (OrderLine line in _orderLines)
        {
            total += line.OrderLineTotal(this);
        }
        return total;
    }
 
    // Nested class
    internal class OrderLine
    {
        public string ProductName { get; set; }
        public int Quantity { get; set; }
        public double Price { get; set; }
 
        public double OrderLineTotal(Order order)
        {
            return Math.Round(Price * Quantity * order.DiscountMultiplier, 2);
        }
    }
}

NB: Although nested classes can access the private members of their parent class, the reverse is not true. Private members of nested classes are invisible to their parent class.
-
C# supports nested classes: a class that is a member of another class.
For example:

        class Car
        {
            string name;
            public Car(string nm)
            {
                name = nm;
                Motor m = new Motor();
            }
            public class Motor
            {
                // some code
            }
        }

The Motor class is nested in the Car class and can be used similar to other members of the class.
A nested class acts as a member of the class, so it can have the same access modifiers as other members (public, private, protected).

MULTI-TENANCY – A CORE BENEFIT OF SAAS
In the early days of the cloud, organizations were reluctant to adopt cloud strategies. Few organizations considered applying policies, technologies, and controls to protect data across the cloud. The last several years, which has seen the proven effectiveness of cloud deployments in scalability, cost, and security, has changed that however. Now we’re seeing the rapid adoption of cloud platforms by organizations of all shapes and sizes.
Digital Guardian’s Data Protection Platform leverages software as a service, or SaaS, to provide data protection in a package that results in superior security, better economics, and reduced overhead. One of the ways we do this is through multi-tenant architecture.
SINGLE TENANT VS MULTI-TENANT – LEARN THE DIFFERENCE
Single Tenant – A single instance of the software and supporting infrastructure serve a single customer. With single tenancy, each customer has his or her own independent database and instance of the software. Essentially, there is no sharing happening with this option.


Potential benefits of single-tenant include:
•	Security: A single customer and a single server is often contained on secure hardware being used by a limited number of people.
•	Dependability: With an entire environment dedicated to one client, resources are abundant and available anytime.
•	Customization: Control over the entire environment allows for customization and added functionality, if desired.
Potential drawbacks of single-tenant:
•	Maintenance: Single-tenant typically means more tasks and regular maintenance to keep things running smoothly and efficiently.
•	Setup/Management: By comparison, SaaS multi-tenant environments are quick to setup and manage.
•	Cost: Single-tenant typically allows for more resources, but at a premium price given that there is only one customer for the entire environment.
Multi-Tenant – Multi-tenancy means that a single instance of the software and its supporting infrastructure serves multiple customers. Each customer shares the software application and also shares a single database. Each tenant’s data is isolated and remains invisible to other tenants.
Potential benefits of multi-tenant:
•	Affordable Cost: Multiple customers means that the cost for the environment is shared, and those savings (from the SaaS vendor) are typically transferred to the cost of the software.
•	Integrations: Cloud environments allow for easier integration with other applications through the use of APIs.
•	“Hands-free” Maintenance: The server technically belongs to the SaaS vendor, meaning that a certain level of database maintenance is handled by the vendor, instead of you maintaining the environment yourself.
Potential drawbacks of multi-tenant:
•	Limited Management/Customization: While you do have added integration benefits, custom changes to the database aren’t typically an option.
•	Security: Other tenants won’t see your data. However, multiple users (not associated with your organization) are allowed on the same database. This broader access reduces control of security.
•	Updates/Changes: If you’re reliant on integrations with other SaaS products and one updates their system, it may cause issues with those connecting apps.

BENEFITS OF SAAS MULTI-TENANT ARCHITECTURE
•	Lower costs through economies of scale: With multi-tenancy, scaling has far fewer infrastructure implications than with a single-tenancy-hosted solution because new users get access to the same basic software.
•	Shared infrastructure leads to lower costs: SaaS allows companies of all sizes to share infrastructure and data center operational costs. There is no need to add applications and more hardware to their environment. Not having to provision or manage any infrastructure or software above and beyond internal resources enables businesses to focus on everyday tasks.
•	Ongoing maintenance and updates: Customers don’t need to pay costly maintenance fees to keep their software up to date. Vendors roll out new features and updates. These are often included with a SaaS subscription.
•	Configuration can be done while leaving the underlying codebase unchanged: Single-tenant-hosted solutions are often customized, requiring changes to an application’s code. This customization can be costly and can make upgrades time-consuming because the upgrade might not be compatible with your environment.
Multi-tenant solutions are designed to be highly configurable so that businesses can make the application perform the way they want. There is no changing the code or data structure, making the upgrade process easy.
Multi-tenancy architecture also allows Digital Guardian to efficiently service everyone from small customers, whose scale may not warrant dedicated infrastructure, to large enterprises that need access to the cloud’s virtually unlimited compute resources. Software development and maintenance costs are shared, driving down expenditures, resulting in savings that are passed onto you, the customers.

C# | is Operator Keyword	(GITHUB)	      (asd)
is nedir, is keyword nedir, is operator nedir

In the development of the software, typecasting is an inescapable thing. In many cases, one needs to convert an object(Type) into another object(Type) and sometimes got InvalidCastException. So, to overcome such types of exception C# provides is operator.
The is operator is used to check if the run-time type of an object is compatible with the given type or not. It returns true if the given object is of the same type otherwise, return false. It also returns false for null objects.
Syntax:
expression is type
Here, the expression will be evaluated to an instance of some type. And type is the name of the type to that the result of the expression is to be converted. If the expression is not null and the object results from evaluating the expression can be converted to the specified type then is operator will return true otherwise it will return false.
Example 1: In the below code, we have three classes i.e. Author, Work and GFG. GFG is the driver class which contains the Main method. Class ‘Author’ and ‘Work’ have data members and method. In the Main method, objects of class Author and Work created and methods of these classes are called using the instance of the class. After that, a bool value bool result; is taken to store the return value of is operator. The line of code i.e. result = a is Author; is used to check whether a(object of class author) is of type Author. It will return true as a is the instance of Author class. But instance w is not of type Author, that’s why it returns false. After that, we are assigning null to object a which will give result false as comparing to an instance of Author.

       var result4 = newInt is 13;
 
       Console.WriteLine(result1);

        G1 obj1 = new G1(); 
          
        // creating an instance  
        // of class G2 
        G2 obj2 = new G2(); 
          
        // checking whether 'obj1' 
        // is of type 'G1' 
        Console.WriteLine(obj1 is G1); 
          
        // checking whether 'obj1' is 
        // of type Object class 
        // (Base class for all classes) 
        Console.WriteLine(obj1 is Object); 
          
        // checking whether 'obj2' 
        // is of type 'G2' 
        Console.WriteLine(obj2 is G2); 
          
        // checking whether 'obj2' is 
        // of type Object class 
        // (Base class for all classes) 
        Console.WriteLine(obj2 is Object); 
          
        // checking whether 'obj2' 
        // is of type 'G1' 
        // it will return true as G2 
        // is derived from G1 
        Console.WriteLine(obj2 is G2); 
          
        // checking whether obj1  
        // is of type G3 
        // it will return false 
        Console.WriteLine(obj1 is G3); 
          
         // checking whether obj2  
        // is of type G3 
        // it will return false 
        Console.WriteLine(obj2 is G3); 
          
          
    } 
} 
Output:
True
True
True
True
True
False
False
Note:
•	Only reference, boxing, and unboxing conversions are considered by the is operator keyword.
•	User-defined conversions or the conversion which are defined using the implicit and explicit are not considered consider by is operator. For the conversions which are known at the compile-time or handled by an implicit operator, is operator will give warnings for that.

Virtual keyword - Lazy Loading - Eager Loading 	(GITHUB)    (asdf)
virtual nedir, virtual keyword nedir, lazyloading nedir, lazy loading nedir, eager loading nedir, eagerloading nedir

This virtual keyword is related to the topic of loading data from entity framework (lazy loading, eager loading and explicit loading).
You should use virtual keyword, when you want to load data with lazy loading.
lazy loading is the process whereby an entity or collection of entities is automatically loaded from the database the first time it is accessed.
For example, when using the Blog entity class defined below, the related Posts will be loaded the first time the Posts navigation property is accessed:
public class Blog 
{  
     public int BlogId { get; set; }  
     public string Name { get; set; }  
     public string Url { get; set; }  
     public string Tags { get; set; }  
     public virtual ICollection<Post> Posts { get; set; }  
}
Lazy loading of the Posts collection can be turned off by making the Posts property non-virtual.
if lazy loading is off, Loading of the Posts collection can still be achieved using eager loading (using Include method) or Explicitly loading related entities (using Load method).
Eagerly Loading:
using (var context = new BloggingContext()) 
{ 
    // Load all blogs and related posts 
    var blogs1 = context.Blogs 
                          .Include(b => b.Posts) 
                          .ToList(); 
}
Explicitly Loading:
using (var context = new BloggingContext()) 
{ 
    var blog = context.Blogs.Find(1); 

    // Load the posts related to a given blog 
    context.Entry(blog).Collection(p => p.Posts).Load(); 
}

Attibute nedir	(testset) (testset)
Attributes provide a powerful method of associating metadata, or declarative information, with code (assemblies, types, methods, properties, and so forth). 
After an attribute is associated with a program entity, the attribute can be queried at run time by using a technique called reflection. For more information, see Reflection (C#).
Attributes have the following properties:
•	Attributes add metadata to your program. Metadata is information about the types defined in a program. All .NET assemblies contain a specified set of metadata that describes the types and type members defined in the assembly. You can add custom attributes to specify any additional information that is required. For more information, see, Creating Custom Attributes (C#).
•	You can apply one or more attributes to entire assemblies, modules, or smaller program elements such as classes and properties.
•	Attributes can accept arguments in the same way as methods and properties.
•	Your program can examine its own metadata or the metadata in other programs by using reflection. For more information, see Accessing Attributes by Using Reflection (C#).

In this example, the SerializableAttribute attribute is used to apply a specific characteristic to a class:
[Serializable]
public class SampleClass
{
    // Objects of this type can be serialized.
}

A method with the attribute DllImportAttribute is declared like the following example:
[System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImport("user32.dll")]
extern static void SampleMethod();
Some attributes can be specified more than once for a given entity. An example of such a multiuse attribute is ConditionalAttribute:
[Conditional("DEBUG"), Conditional("TEST1")]
void TraceMethod()
{
    // ...
}

[DllImport("user32.dll")]
[DllImport("user32.dll", SetLastError=false, ExactSpelling=false)]
[DllImport("user32.dll", ExactSpelling=false, SetLastError=false)]
The first parameter, the DLL name, is positional and always comes first; the others are named. In this case, both named parameters default to false, so they can be omitted. Positional parameters correspond to the parameters of the attribute constructor. Named or optional parameters correspond to either properties or fields of the attribute. Refer to the individual attribute's documentation for information on default parameter values.

Object nedir	(GITHUB) (empty)
Everything in C# is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.
A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

Shadow property nedir	(GITHUB) (asasas)
Shadow properties are properties that are not defined in your .NET entity class but are defined for that entity type in the EF Core model. 
This means that we can have columns for these properties in our tables, but we will not have a corresponding property field in our entity class. This is really helpful while designing our domain models as this helps to avoid unnecessary fields from the domain models which don't add any value to our domain logic but are required in our database.

Continuous Integration?	(GITHUB) (testset)
Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each integration can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests. While automated testing is not strictly part of CI it is typically implied.

Futbolda her karşısına çıkan oyuncuya çalım atan kişi akla geliyo.. Her bir rakip oyuncu: müşteri isteğindeki değişim… Extreme programming ile proje, her bir engele karşı ilerlemeye devam ediyor.

Extreme programming (XP) is a software development methodology which is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. As a type of agile software development,[1][2][3] it advocates frequent "releases" in short development cycles, which is intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints at which new customer requirements can be adopted.
 
Other elements of extreme programming include: programming in pairs or doing extensive code review, unit testing of all code, not programming features until they are actually needed, a flat management structure, code simplicity and clarity, expecting changes in the customer's requirements as time passes and the problem is better understood, and frequent communication with the customer and among programmers.[2][3][4] The methodology takes its name from the idea that the beneficial elements of traditional software engineering practices are taken to "extreme" levels. As an example, code reviews are considered a beneficial practice; taken to the extreme, code can be reviewed continuously, i.e. the practice of pair programming.

Generic / Generics	(GITHUB) (testset)
Generic nedir, generic class nedir, generics nedir
Generics allow you to define the specification of the data type of programming elements in a class or a method, until it is actually used in the program. In other words, generics allow you to write a class or method that can work with any data type.
You write the specifications for the class or the method, with substitute parameters for data types. When the compiler encounters a constructor for the class or a function call for the method, it generates code to handle the specific data type. A simple example would help understanding the concept −
Live Demo
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace GenericApplication {
   public class MyGenericArray<T> {
      private T[] array;
      
      public MyGenericArray(int size) {
         array = new T[size + 1];
      }
      public T getItem(int index) {
         return array[index];
      }
      public void setItem(int index, T value) {
         array[index] = value;
      }
   }
   class Tester {
      static void Main(string[] args) {
         
         //declaring an int array
         MyGenericArray<int> intArray = new MyGenericArray<int>(5);
         
         //setting values
         for (int c = 0; c < 5; c++) {
            intArray.setItem(c, c*5);
         }
         
         //retrieving the values
         for (int c = 0; c < 5; c++) {
            Console.Write(intArray.getItem(c) + " ");
         }
         
         Console.WriteLine();
         
         //declaring a character array
         MyGenericArray<char> charArray = new MyGenericArray<char>(5);
         
         //setting values
         for (int c = 0; c < 5; c++) {
            charArray.setItem(c, (char)(c+97));
         }
         
         //retrieving the values
         for (int c = 0; c< 5; c++) {
            Console.Write(charArray.getItem(c) + " ");
         }
         Console.WriteLine();
         
         Console.ReadKey();
      }
   }
}
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −
0 5 10 15 20
a b c d e
Features of Generics
Generics is a technique that enriches your programs in the following ways −
•	It helps you to maximize code reuse, type safety, and performance.
•	You can create generic collection classes. The .NET Framework class library contains several new generic collection classes in the System.Collections.Generic namespace. You may use these generic collection classes instead of the collection classes in the System.Collections namespace.
•	You can create your own generic interfaces, classes, methods, events, and delegates.
•	You may create generic classes constrained to enable access to methods on particular data types.
•	You may get information on the types used in a generic data type at run-time by means of reflection.
Generic Methods
In the previous example, we have used a generic class; we can declare a generic method with a type parameter. The following program illustrates the concept −
Live Demo
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace GenericMethodAppl {
   class Program {
      static void Swap<T>(ref T lhs, ref T rhs) {
         T temp;
         temp = lhs;
         lhs = rhs;
         rhs = temp;
      }
      static void Main(string[] args) {
         int a, b;
         char c, d;
         a = 10;
         b = 20;
         c = 'I';
         d = 'V';
         
         //display values before swap:
         Console.WriteLine("Int values before calling swap:");
         Console.WriteLine("a = {0}, b = {1}", a, b);
         Console.WriteLine("Char values before calling swap:");
         Console.WriteLine("c = {0}, d = {1}", c, d);
         
         //call swap
         Swap<int>(ref a, ref b);
         Swap<char>(ref c, ref d);
         
         //display values after swap:
         Console.WriteLine("Int values after calling swap:");
         Console.WriteLine("a = {0}, b = {1}", a, b);
         Console.WriteLine("Char values after calling swap:");
         Console.WriteLine("c = {0}, d = {1}", c, d);
         
         Console.ReadKey();
      }
   }
}
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −
Int values before calling swap:
a = 10, b = 20
Char values before calling swap:
c = I, d = V
Int values after calling swap:
a = 20, b = 10
Char values after calling swap:
c = V, d = I
Generic Delegates
You can define a generic delegate with type parameters. For example −
delegate T NumberChanger<T>(T n);
The following example shows use of this delegate −
Live Demo
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

delegate T NumberChanger<T>(T n);
namespace GenericDelegateAppl {
   class TestDelegate {
      static int num = 10;
      
      public static int AddNum(int p) {
         num += p;
         return num;
      }
      public static int MultNum(int q) {
         num *= q;
         return num;
      }
      public static int getNum() {
         return num;
      }
      static void Main(string[] args) {
         //create delegate instances
         NumberChanger<int> nc1 = new NumberChanger<int>(AddNum);
         NumberChanger<int> nc2 = new NumberChanger<int>(MultNum);
         
         //calling the methods using the delegate objects
         nc1(25);
         Console.WriteLine("Value of Num: {0}", getNum());
         
         nc2(5);
         Console.WriteLine("Value of Num: {0}", getNum());
         Console.ReadKey();
      }
   }
}
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −
Value of Num: 35
Value of Num: 175

C# Generics
Generic means the general form, not specific. In C#, generic means not specific to a particular data type.
C# allows you to define generic classes, interfaces, abstract classes, fields, methods, static methods, properties, events, delegates, and operators using the type parameter and without the specific data type. A type parameter is a placeholder for a particular type specified when creating an instance of the generic type.
A generic type is declared by specifying a type parameter in an angle brackets after a type name, e.g. TypeName<T> where T is a type parameter.
Generic Class
Generic classes are defined using a type parameter in an angle brackets after the class name. The following defines a generic class.
class DataStore<T>
{
    public T Data { get; set; }
}
Above, the DataStore is a generic class. T is called type parameter, which can be used as a type of fields, properties, method parameters, return types, and delegates in the DataStore class. For example, Data is generic property because we have used a type parameter T as its type instead of the specific data type.
 Note
It is not required to use T as a type parameter. You can give any name to a type parameter. Generally, T is used when there is only one type parameter. It is recommended to use a more readable type parameter name as per requirement like TSession, TKey, TValue etc. Learn more about Type Parameter Naming Guidelines
You can also define multiple type parameters separated by a comma.
Example: Generic Class with Multiple Type Parameters
class KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>
{
    public TKey Key { get; set; }
    public TValue Value { get; set; }
}
Instantiating Generic Class
You can create an instance of generic classes by specifying an actual type in angle brackets. The following creates an instance of the generic class DataStore.
DataStore<string> store = new DataStore<string>();
Above, we specified the string type in the angle brackets while creating an instance. So, T will be replaced with a string type wherever T is used in the entire class at compile-time. Therefore, the type of Data property would be a string.
The following figure illustrates how generics works.
 
You can assign a string value to the Data property. Trying to assign values other than string will result in a compile-time error.
DataStore<string> store = new DataStore<string>();
store.Data = "Hello World!";
//obj.Data = 123; //compile-time error
You can specify the different data types for different objects, as shown below.
Example: Generic class
DataStore<string> strStore = new DataStore<string>();
strStore.Data = "Hello World!";
//strStore.Data = 123; // compile-time error

DataStore<int> intStore = new DataStore<int>();
intStore.Data = 100;
//intStore.Data = "Hello World!"; // compile-time error

KeyValuePair<int, string> kvp1 = new KeyValuePair<int, string>();
kvp1.Key = 100;
kvp1.Value = "Hundred";

KeyValuePair<string, string> kvp2 = new KeyValuePair<string, string>();
kvp2.Key = "IT";
kvp2.Value = "Information Technology";

Generic Class Characteristics
•	A generic class increases the reusability. The more type parameters mean more reusable it becomes. However, too much generalization makes code difficult to understand and maintain.
•	A generic class can be a base class to other generic or non-generic classes or abstract classes.
•	A generic class can be derived from other generic or non-generic interfaces, classes, or abstract classes.
Generic Fields
A generic class can include generic fields. However, it cannot be initialized.
Example: Generic Field
class DataStore<T>
{
    public T data;
}
The following declares a generic array.
Example: Generic Array
class DataStore<T>
{
    public T[] data = new T[10];
}
Generic Methods
A method declared with the type parameters for its return type or parameters is called a generic method.
Example: Generic Methods
class DataStore<T>
{
    private T[] _data = new T[10];
    
    public void AddOrUpdate(int index, T item)
    {
        if(index >= 0 && index < 10)
            _data[index] = item;
    }

    public T GetData(int index)
    {
        if(index >= 0 && index < 10)
            return _data[index];
        else 
            return default(T);
    }
}
Above, the AddorUpdate() and the GetData() methods are generic methods. The actual data type of the item parameter will be specified at the time of instantiating the DataStore<T> class, as shown below.
Example: Generic Methods
DataStore<string> cities = new DataStore<string>();
cities.AddOrUpdate(0, "Mumbai");
cities.AddOrUpdate(1, "Chicago");
cities.AddOrUpdate(2, "London");

DataStore<int> empIds = new DataStore<int>();
empIds.AddOrUpdate(0, 50);
empIds.AddOrUpdate(1, 65);
empIds.AddOrUpdate(2, 89);
Try it
The generic parameter type can be used with multiple parameters with or without non-generic parameters and return type. The followings are valid generic method overloading.
Example: Generic Method Overloading
public void AddOrUpdate(int index, T data) { }
public void AddOrUpdate(T data1, T data2) { }
public void AddOrUpdate<U>(T data1, U data2) { }
public void AddOrUpdate(T data) { }
A non-generic class can include generic methods by specifying a type parameter in angle brackets with the method name, as shown below.
Example: Generic Method in Non-generic Class
class Printer
{
    public void Print<T>(T data)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(data);
    }
}

Printer printer = new Printer();
printer.Print<int>(100);
printer.Print(200); // type infer from the specified value
printer.Print<string>("Hello");
printer.Print("World!"); // type infer from the specified value
Try it
Advantages of Generics
1.	Generics increase the reusability of the code. You don't need to write code to handle different data types.
2.	Generics are type-safe. You get compile-time errors if you try to use a different data type than the one specified in the definition.
3.	Generic has a performance advantage because it removes the possibilities of boxing and unboxing.

Abstract class / Abstract method / Abstract keyword
Abstract class nedir, abstract method nedir, abstract keyword nedir

Msdn:
The abstract modifier indicates that the thing being modified has a missing or incomplete implementation. The abstract modifier can be used with classes, methods, properties, indexers, and events. Use the abstract modifier in a class declaration to indicate that a class is intended only to be a base class of other classes, not instantiated on its own. Members marked as abstract must be implemented by non-abstract classes that derive from the abstract class.
Example
In this example, the class Square must provide an implementation of GetArea because it derives from Shape:
abstract class Shape
{
    public abstract int GetArea();
}

class Square : Shape
{
    int side;

    public Square(int n) => side = n;

    // GetArea method is required to avoid a compile-time error.
    public override int GetArea() => side * side;

    static void Main()
    {
        var sq = new Square(12);
        Console.WriteLine($"Area of the square = {sq.GetArea()}");
    }
}
// Output: Area of the square = 144
Abstract classes have the following features:
•	An abstract class cannot be instantiated.
•	An abstract class may contain abstract methods and accessors.
•	It is not possible to modify an abstract class with the sealed modifier because the two modifiers have opposite meanings. The sealed modifier prevents a class from being inherited and the abstract modifier requires a class to be inherited.
•	A non-abstract class derived from an abstract class must include actual implementations of all inherited abstract methods and accessors.
Use the abstract modifier in a method or property declaration to indicate that the method or property does not contain implementation.
Abstract methods have the following features:
•	An abstract method is implicitly a virtual method.
•	Abstract method declarations are only permitted in abstract classes.
•	Because an abstract method declaration provides no actual implementation, there is no method body; the method declaration simply ends with a semicolon and there are no curly braces ({ }) following the signature. For example:
public abstract void MyMethod();  
The implementation is provided by a method override, which is a member of a non-abstract class.
•	It is an error to use the static or virtual modifiers in an abstract method declaration.
Abstract properties behave like abstract methods, except for the differences in declaration and invocation syntax.
•	It is an error to use the abstract modifier on a static property.
•	An abstract inherited property can be overridden in a derived class by including a property declaration that uses the override modifier.
For more information about abstract classes, see Abstract and Sealed Classes and Class Members.
An abstract class must provide implementation for all interface members.
An abstract class that implements an interface might map the interface methods onto abstract methods. For example:
interface I
{
    void M();
}

abstract class C : I
{
    public abstract void M();
}

Example
In this example, the class DerivedClass is derived from an abstract class BaseClass. The abstract class contains an abstract method, AbstractMethod, and two abstract properties, X and Y.
abstract class BaseClass   // Abstract class
{
    protected int _x = 100;
    protected int _y = 150;
    public abstract void AbstractMethod();   // Abstract method
    public abstract int X    { get; }
    public abstract int Y    { get; }
}

class DerivedClass : BaseClass
{
    public override void AbstractMethod()
    {
        _x++;
        _y++;
    }

    public override int X   // overriding property
    {
        get
        {
            return _x + 10;
        }
    }

    public override int Y   // overriding property
    {
        get
        {
            return _y + 10;
        }
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        var o = new DerivedClass();
        o.AbstractMethod();
        Console.WriteLine($"x = {o.X}, y = {o.Y}");
    }
}
// Output: x = 111, y = 161
In the preceding example, if you attempt to instantiate the abstract class by using a statement like this:
BaseClass bc = new BaseClass();   // Error  
You will get an error saying that the compiler cannot create an instance of the abstract class 'BaseClass'.

www nedir, world wide web nedir
World Wide Web, Dünya Çapında Ağ (kısaca WWW veya Web), İnternet üzerinde yayınlanan birbirleriyle bağlantılı hiper-metin dokümanlarından oluşan bir bilgi sistemidir. Bu dokümanların her birine Web sayfası adı verilir ve Web sayfalarına İnternet kullanıcısının bilgisayarında çalışan Web tarayıcısı adı verilen bilgisayar programları aracılığıyla erişilir. Web sayfalarında metin, imaj, video ve diğer multimedya ögeleri bulunabilir ve diğer bağlantı ya da link adı verilen hiper-bağlantılar ile başka Web sayfalarına geçiş yapılabilir.

İnternet ve Web terimleri aynı olguyu tanımlamaz. Zira Web sadece İnternet üzerinde çalışan bir servistir. Web kavramı, CERN'de bir bilgisayar programcısı olan Tim Berners-Lee'nin HTML adlı metin işaretleme dilini geliştirmesiyle oluşmuştur. Bugün de kendisinin başkanı olduğu W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) tarafından standartları belirlenmektedir.

Yapısı
Web’in temeli İnternet'tir. Web İnternet üzerinde kurulmuştur ve İnternet'in sunduğu mekanizmalardan çoğunun kullanılmasını sağlar. İnternet'in fiziksel görünüşleri –bilgisayarlar, ağlar ve servisler– Dünya üzerindeki diğer binlerce bilgisayara bağlanmamıza izin verir. Web, İnternet'in en tepesindeki soyutlanmış genel servisler kümesidir. World Wide Web (W3), insanların fikir ve projelerinin paylaşılmasını sağlayan bir bilgi ve kültür havuzudur. İstemci-sunucu uygulamaları ile yapılan birçok organizasyon üzerinde Web tarayıcıları istemci olarak çalışabilirler. Web yürütümü standart İstemci-sunucu modelini izler. Aşağıdaki şekilde gösterildiği gibi "Web tarayıcısı" adı verilen programı çalıştıran bir istemci bilgisayar ile Web sunucu yazılımı çalıştıran bir sunucu bilgisayar arasındaki etkileşime "istemci-sunucu" etkileşimi adı verilir. İstemci bilgisayar sunucudan HTTP'yi (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) ve İnternet mesaj standardı TCP/IP'yi kullanarak bir doküman ister ve sunucu istemcinin göstereceği dokümanı geri döndürür.

Abstract Classes and Methods	(testset) (testset)
Abstraction nedir, abstract class nedir, abstract method nedir
In c#, Abstraction is a principle of object-oriented programming language (OOP) and it is used to hide the implementation details and display only essential features of the object.
 
In Abstraction, by using access modifiers we can hide the required details of the object and expose only necessary methods and properties through the reference of an object.
 
In real-time, the laptop is a perfect example of abstraction in c#. A laptop that consists of many things such as processor, RAM, motherboard, LCD screen, camera, USB ports, battery, speakers, etc. To use it, we just need to know how to operate the laptop by switching it on, we don’t need to know how internally all the parts are working. Here, the laptop is an object which is designed to expose only required features by hiding its implementation details.
 
In object-oriented programming, a class is the perfect example of abstraction. In c#, we can create a class with required methods, properties and we can expose only necessary methods and properties using access modifiers based on our requirements.
 
Following is the example of defining a class with required methods, properties and exposing it by using access modifiers to achieve abstraction functionality.
 
public class Laptop
{
    private string brand;
    private string model;
    public string Brand
    {
        get { return brand; }
        set { brand = value; }
    }
    public string Model
    {
        get { return model; }
        set { model = value; }
    }
    public void LaptopDetails()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Brand: " + Brand);
        Console.WriteLine("Model: " + Model);
    }
    public void LaptopKeyboard()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Type using Keyword");
    }
    private void MotherBoardInfo()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("MotheBoard Information");
    }
    private void InternalProcessor()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Processor Information");
    }
}
If you observe the above code, we defined a Laptop class with required fields, properties and methods with the public, private access modifiers to achieve an abstraction functionality by hiding and exposing some of the methods and properties based on our requirements.
 
Here, the public modifier is used to allow defined fields, properties and methods to access outside of the class and the private modifier is used to hide or restrict access of required fields, properties and methods from the outside of class.
 
By creating an instance of Laptop class we can access defined fields, properties, and methods. Following is the pictorial representation of creating an instance of a class and accessing fields, properties and methods.
 
 
 
If you observe the above diagram, we are exposing only the necessary properties and methods outside of the class by using public and private access modifiers.
C# Abstraction Example
Following is the example of implementing an abstraction functionality by allowing only a few properties and methods to access outside of the class in c# programming language.
 
using System;
using System.Text;
 
namespace Tutlane
{
    public class Laptop
    {
        private string brand;
        private string model;
        public string Brand
        {
            get { return brand; }
            set { brand = value; }
        }
        public string Model
        {
            get { return model; }
            set { model = value; }
        }
        public void LaptopDetails()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Brand: " + Brand);
            Console.WriteLine("Model: " + Model);
        }
        public void LaptopKeyboard()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Type using Keyword");
        }
        private void MotherBoardInfo()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("MotheBoard Information");
        }
        private void InternalProcessor()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Processor Information");
        }
    }
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Laptop l = new Laptop();
            l.Brand = "Dell";
            l.Model = "Inspiron 14R";
            l.LaptopDetails();
            Console.WriteLine("\nPress Enter Key to Exit..");
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}
If you observe above example, we defined a fields, properties and methods with public, private access modifiers to allow or disallow properties, methods access based on requirements.
 
When you execute the above c# program, you will get the result as shown below.
 
 
Difference between Abstraction and Encapsulation
The following are the differences between abstraction and encapsulation in c# programming language.
 
Abstraction	Encapsulation
It is used to hide unwanted data and shows only the required properties and methods.	It is used to bind data members and member functions into a single unit to prevent outsiders to access it directly.
This is how we can use abstraction to hide implementation details and showing only essential features based on our requirements in c# programing language. 

-
Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.
Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces (which you will learn more about in the next chapter).
The abstract keyword is used for classes and methods:
•	Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).


•	Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the derived class (inherited from).
An abstract class can have both abstract and regular methods:

abstract class Animal 
{
  public abstract void animalSound();
  public void sleep() 
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Zzz");
  }
}
 
 
From the example above, it is not possible to create an object of the Animal class:
Animal myObj = new Animal(); // Will generate an error (Cannot create an instance of the abstract class or interface 'Animal')
To access the abstract class, it must be inherited from another class. Let's convert the Animal class we used in the Polymorphism chapter to an abstract class.
Remember from the Inheritance chapter that we use the : symbol to inherit from a class, and that we use the override keyword to override the base class method.
Example
// Abstract class
abstract class Animal
{
  // Abstract method (does not have a body)
  public abstract void animalSound();
  // Regular method
  public void sleep()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Zzz");
  }
}

// Derived class (inherit from Animal)
class Pig : Animal
{
  public override void animalSound()
  {
    // The body of animalSound() is provided here
    Console.WriteLine("The pig says: wee wee");
  }
}

class Program
{
  static void Main(string[] args)
  {

In c#, Abstraction is a principle of object-oriented programming language (OOP) and it is used to hide the implementation details and display only essential features of the object.
 

In Abstraction, by using access modifiers we can hide the required details of the object and expose only necessary methods and properties through the reference of an object.
 
In real-time, the laptop is a perfect example of abstraction in c#. A laptop that consists of many things such as processor, RAM, motherboard, LCD screen, camera, USB ports, battery, speakers, etc. To use it, we just need to know how to operate the laptop by switching it on, we don’t need to know how internally all the parts are working. Here, the laptop is an object which is designed to expose only required features by hiding its implementation details.
 
In object-oriented programming, a class is the perfect example of abstraction. In c#, we can create a class with required methods, properties and we can expose only necessary methods and properties using access modifiers based on our requirements.
 
Following is the example of defining a class with required methods, properties and exposing it by using access modifiers to achieve abstraction functionality.
 
public class Laptop
{
    private string brand;
    private string model;
    public string Brand
    {
        get { return brand; }
        set { brand = value; }
    }
    public string Model
    {
        get { return model; }
        set { model = value; }
    }
    public void LaptopDetails()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Brand: " + Brand);
        Console.WriteLine("Model: " + Model);
    }
    public void LaptopKeyboard()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Type using Keyword");
    }
    private void MotherBoardInfo()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("MotheBoard Information");
    }
    private void InternalProcessor()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Processor Information");
    }
}
If you observe the above code, we defined a Laptop class with required fields, properties and methods with the public, private access modifiers to achieve an abstraction functionality by hiding and exposing some of the methods and properties based on our requirements.
 
Here, the public modifier is used to allow defined fields, properties and methods to access outside of the class and the private modifier is used to hide or restrict access of required fields, properties and methods from the outside of class.
 
By creating an instance of Laptop class we can access defined fields, properties, and methods. Following is the pictorial representation of creating an instance of a class and accessing fields, properties and methods.
 
 
 
If you observe the above diagram, we are exposing only the necessary properties and methods outside of the class by using public and private access modifiers.
C# Abstraction Example
Following is the example of implementing an abstraction functionality by allowing only a few properties and methods to access outside of the class in c# programming language.
 
using System;
using System.Text;
 
namespace Tutlane
{
    public class Laptop
    {
        private string brand;
        private string model;
        public string Brand
        {
            get { return brand; }
            set { brand = value; }
        }
        public string Model
        {
            get { return model; }
            set { model = value; }
        }
        public void LaptopDetails()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Brand: " + Brand);
            Console.WriteLine("Model: " + Model);
        }
        public void LaptopKeyboard()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Type using Keyword");
        }
        private void MotherBoardInfo()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("MotheBoard Information");
        }
        private void InternalProcessor()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Processor Information");
        }
    }
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Laptop l = new Laptop();
            l.Brand = "Dell";
            l.Model = "Inspiron 14R";
            l.LaptopDetails();
            Console.WriteLine("\nPress Enter Key to Exit..");
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}
If you observe above example, we defined a fields, properties and methods with public, private access modifiers to allow or disallow properties, methods access based on requirements.
 
When you execute the above c# program, you will get the result as shown below.
 
 
Difference between Abstraction and Encapsulation
The following are the differences between abstraction and encapsulation in c# programming language.
 
Abstraction	Encapsulation
It is used to hide unwanted data and shows only the required properties and methods.	It is used to bind data members and member functions into a single unit to prevent outsiders to access it directly.
This is how we can use abstraction to hide implementation details and showing only essential features based on our requirements in c# programing language.

Cyclomatic Complexity
Cyclomatic complexity nedir
Cyclomatic complexity of a code section is the quantitative measure of the number of linearly independent paths in it. It is a software metric used to indicate the complexity of a program. It is computed using the Control Flow Graph of the program. The nodes in the graph indicate the smallest group of commands of a program, and a directed edge in it connects the two nodes i.e. if second command might immediately follow the first command. 
For example, if source code contains no control flow statement then its cyclomatic complexity will be 1 and source code contains a single path in it. Similarly, if the source code contains one if condition then cyclomatic complexity will be 2 because there will be two paths one for true and the other for false. 
Mathematically, for a structured program, the directed graph inside control flow is the edge joining two basic blocks of the program as control may pass from first to second. 
So, cyclomatic complexity M would be defined as, 
 
M = E – N + 2P 
where, 
E = the number of edges in the control flow graph 
N = the number of nodes in the control flow graph 
P = the number of connected components 
 
Steps that should be followed in calculating cyclomatic complexity and test cases design are: 
 
•	Construction of graph with nodes and edges from code.
•	Identification of independent paths.
•	Cyclomatic Complexity Calculation
•	Design of Test Cases
Let a section of code as such: 
 
A = 10
   IF B > C THEN
      A = B
   ELSE
      A = C
   ENDIF
Print A
Print B
Print C

 
Control Flow Graph of above code
 
 
The cyclomatic complexity calculated for above code will be from control flow graph. The graph shows seven shapes(nodes), seven lines(edges), hence cyclomatic complexity is 7-7+2 = 2. 
Use of Cyclomatic Complexity: 
 
•	Determining the independent path executions thus proven to be very helpful for Developers and Testers.
•	It can make sure that every path have been tested at least once.
•	Thus help to focus more on uncovered paths.
•	Code coverage can be improved.
•	Risk associated with program can be evaluated.
•	These metrics being used earlier in the program helps in reducing the risks.
Advantages of Cyclomatic Complexity:.
•	It can be used as a quality metric, gives relative complexity of various designs.
•	It is able to compute faster than the Halstead’s metrics.
•	It is used to measure the minimum effort and best areas of concentration for testing.
•	It is able to guide the testing process.
•	It is easy to apply.
Disadvantages of Cyclomatic Complexity:
•	It is the measure of the programs’s control complexity and not the data the data complexity.
•	In this, nested conditional structures are harder to understand than non-nested structures.
•	In case of simple comparisons and decision strucures, it may give a misleading figure.

Dependency Injection	(GITHUB) (testset)

Dependency injection nedir, dependency Injection nedir
https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/ioc/dependency-injection
In the previous chapter, related to DIP, we created and used abstraction to make the classes loosely coupled. Here, we are going to implement Dependency Injection and strategy pattern together to move the dependency object creation completely out of the class. This is our third step in making the classes completely loose coupled.
 
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to implement IoC. It allows the creation of dependent objects outside of a class and provides those objects to a class through different ways. Using DI, we move the creation and binding of the dependent objects outside of the class that depends on them.
The Dependency Injection pattern involves 3 types of classes.
1.	Client Class: The client class (dependent class) is a class which depends on the service class
2.	Service Class: The service class (dependency) is a class that provides service to the client class.
3.	Injector Class: The injector class injects the service class object into the client class.
The following figure illustrates the relationship between these classes:
 
Dependency Injection
As you can see, the injector class creates an object of the service class, and injects that object to a client object. In this way, the DI pattern separates the responsibility of creating an object of the service class out of the client class.
Types of Dependency Injection
As you have seen above, the injector class injects the service (dependency) to the client (dependent). The injector class injects dependencies broadly in three ways: through a constructor, through a property, or through a method.
Constructor Injection: In the constructor injection, the injector supplies the service (dependency) through the client class constructor.
Property Injection: In the property injection (aka the Setter Injection), the injector supplies the dependency through a public property of the client class.
Method Injection: In this type of injection, the client class implements an interface which declares the method(s) to supply the dependency and the injector uses this interface to supply the dependency to the client class.
Let's take an example from the previous chapter to maintain the continuity. In the previous section of DIP, we used Factory class inside the CustomerBusinessLogic class to get an object of the CustomerDataAccess object, as shown below.
public interface ICustomerDataAccess
{
    string GetCustomerName(int id);
}

public class CustomerDataAccess: ICustomerDataAccess
{
    public CustomerDataAccess() {
    }

    public string GetCustomerName(int id) {
        return "Dummy Customer Name"; 
    }
}

public class DataAccessFactory
{
    public static ICustomerDataAccess GetCustomerDataAccessObj() 
    {
        return new CustomerDataAccess();
    }
}

public class CustomerBusinessLogic
{
    ICustomerDataAccess _custDataAccess;

    public CustomerBusinessLogic()
    {
        _custDataAccess = DataAccessFactory.GetCustomerDataAccessObj();
    }

    public string GetCustomerName(int id)
    {
        return _custDataAccess.GetCustomerName(id);
    }
}
The problem with the above example is that we used DataAccessFactory inside the CustomerBusinessLogic class. So, suppose there is another implementation of ICustomerDataAccess and we want to use that new class inside CustomerBusinessLogic. Then, we need to change the source code of the CustomerBusinessLogic class as well. The Dependency injection pattern solves this problem by injecting dependent objects via a constructor, a property, or an interface.
The following figure illustrates the DI pattern implementation for the above example.
 
Dependency Injection
As you see, the CustomerService class becomes the injector class, which sets an object of the service class (CustomerDataAccess) to the client class (CustomerBusinessLogic) either through a constructor, a property, or a method to achieve loose coupling. Let's explore each of these options.

-
Constructor Injection
As mentioned before, when we provide the dependency through the constructor, this is called a constructor injection.
Consider the following example where we have implemented DI using the constructor.

public class CustomerBusinessLogic
{
    ICustomerDataAccess _dataAccess;

    public CustomerBusinessLogic(ICustomerDataAccess custDataAccess)
    {
        _dataAccess = custDataAccess;
    }

    public CustomerBusinessLogic()
    {
        _dataAccess = new CustomerDataAccess();
    }

    public string ProcessCustomerData(int id)
    {
        return _dataAccess.GetCustomerName(id);
    }
}

public interface ICustomerDataAccess
{
    string GetCustomerName(int id);
}

public class CustomerDataAccess: ICustomerDataAccess
{
    public CustomerDataAccess()
    {
    }

    public string GetCustomerName(int id) 
    {
        //get the customer name from the db in real application        
        return "Dummy Customer Name"; 
    }
}
In the above example, CustomerBusinessLogic includes the constructor with one parameter of type ICustomerDataAccess. Now, the calling class must inject an object of ICustomerDataAccess.
public class CustomerService
{
    CustomerBusinessLogic _customerBL;

    public CustomerService()
    {
        _customerBL = new CustomerBusinessLogic(new CustomerDataAccess());
    }

    public string GetCustomerName(int id) {
        return _customerBL.ProcessCustomerData(id);
    }
}
As you can see in the above example, the CustomerService class creates and injects the CustomerDataAccess object into the CustomerBusinessLogic class. Thus, the CustomerBusinessLogic class doesn't need to create an object of CustomerDataAccess using the new keyword or using factory class. The calling class (CustomerService) creates and sets the appropriate DataAccess class to the CustomerBusinessLogic class. In this way, the CustomerBusinessLogic and CustomerDataAccess classes become "more" loosely coupled classes.
Property Injection
In the property injection, the dependency is provided through a public property. Consider the following example.
Example: Property Injection - C#
 Copy
public class CustomerBusinessLogic
{
    public CustomerBusinessLogic()
    {
    }

    public string GetCustomerName(int id)
    {
        return DataAccess.GetCustomerName(id);
    }

    public ICustomerDataAccess DataAccess { get; set; }
}

public class CustomerService
{
    CustomerBusinessLogic _customerBL;

    public CustomerService()
    {
        _customerBL = new CustomerBusinessLogic();
        _customerBL.DataAccess = new CustomerDataAccess();
    }

    public string GetCustomerName(int id) {
        return _customerBL.GetCustomerName(id);
    }
}
As you can see above, the CustomerBusinessLogic class includes the public property named DataAccess, where you can set an instance of a class that implements ICustomerDataAccess. So, CustomerService class creates and sets CustomerDataAccess class using this public property.
Method Injection
In the method injection, dependencies are provided through methods. This method can be a class method or an interface method.
The following example demonstrates the method injection using an interface based method.
Example: Interface Injection - C#
 Copy
interface IDataAccessDependency
{
    void SetDependency(ICustomerDataAccess customerDataAccess);
}

public class CustomerBusinessLogic : IDataAccessDependency
{
    ICustomerDataAccess _dataAccess;

    public CustomerBusinessLogic()
    {
    }

    public string GetCustomerName(int id)
    {
        return _dataAccess.GetCustomerName(id);
    }
        
    public void SetDependency(ICustomerDataAccess customerDataAccess)
    {
        _dataAccess = customerDataAccess;
    }
}

public class CustomerService
{
    CustomerBusinessLogic _customerBL;

    public CustomerService()
    {
        _customerBL = new CustomerBusinessLogic();
        ((IDataAccessDependency)_customerBL).SetDependency(new CustomerDataAccess());
    }

    public string GetCustomerName(int id) {
        return _customerBL.GetCustomerName(id);
    }
}
In the above example, the CustomerBusinessLogic class implements the IDataAccessDependency interface, which includes the SetDependency() mehtod. So, the injector class CustomerService will now use this method to inject the dependent class (CustomerDataAccess) to the client class.
Thus, you can use DI and strategy pattern to create loose coupled classes.
So far, we have used several principles and patterns to achieve loosely coupled classes. In professional projects, there are many dependent classes and implementing these patterns is time consuming. Here the IoC Container (aka the DI container) helps us. Learn about the IoC Container in the next chapter.
Learn more about the IoC and Dependency Injection here.

IoC container	(GITHUB) (testset)
Container nedir, IoC container nedir, unity container nedir, unity nedir, inversion of control nedir, dependency injection nedir
Unity Container: Register and Resolve
In the previous section, we installed Unity framework in our console project. Here, we will learn how to register type-mapping and resolve it using the unity container.
As we learned in the IoC container chapter, every container must provide a way to register and resolve dependencies. Unity container provides the RegisterType() and Resolve() methods for this.
We are going to use the following sample classes to demo the registration and resolution of dependencies throughout this chapter.
Example: C#
 Copy
public interface ICar
{
    int Run();
}

public class BMW : ICar
{
    private int _miles = 0;

    public int Run()
    {
        return ++_miles;
    }
}

public class Ford : ICar
{
    private int _miles = 0;

    public int Run()
    {
        return ++_miles;
    }
}

public class Audi : ICar
{
    private int _miles = 0;

    public int Run()
    {
        return ++_miles;
    }

}
public class Driver
{
    private ICar _car = null;

    public Driver(ICar car)
    {
        _car = car;
    }

    public void RunCar()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Running {0} - {1} mile ", _car.GetType().Name, _car.Run());
    }
}
As you can see in the sample classes, the Driver class depends on the ICar interface. So, when we instantiate the Driver class object, then we will have to pass an instance of a class which implements the ICar interface, such as the BMW, Audi or Ford class as shown below.
Example: C#
 Copy
Driver driver = new Driver(new BMW());

driver.RunCar();
Output:
Running BMW - 1 mile
In the above example, we created and passed an object of BMW while creating an object of the Driver class. Thus, we injected the dependency of the Driver class manually. Now, we will use Unity container to understand different ways to register and resolve dependencies.
Using UnityContainer
In order to use Unity container, we first need to create an object of it. You can use any class which implements the IUnityContainer interface. Unity container includes the UnityContainer class in the Microsoft.Practices.Unity namespace that implements the IUnityContainer interface. If you need to extend the container, then you can create your own custom class and implement the IUnityContainer interface as per your need.
Example: Instantiate UnityContainer - C#
 Copy
using Microsoft.Practices.Unity;

IUnityContainer container = new UnityContainer();
//or
var container = new UnityContainer();
Next, we need to register type-mapping.
Register
Before Unity resolves the dependencies, we need to register the type-mapping with the container, so that it can create the correct object for the given type. Use the RegisterType() method to register a type mapping. Basically, it configures which class to instantiate for which interface or base class. For example, if we want Unity container to create and supply an object of the BMW class whenever it needs to supply a dependency of the ICar interface, then we first need to register it as shown below.
Example: Register Type with Unity - C#
 Copy
IUnityContainer container = new UnityContainer();

container.RegisterType<ICar, BMW>();
Here, container.RegisterType<ICar, BMW>() requests Unity to create an object of the BMW class and inject it through a constructor whenever you need to inject an object of ICar.
The RegisterType method includes many overloads. Learn about all the overloads of RegisterType on MSDN.
So now, after registration, we can use the Resolve() method.
Resolve
Unity creates an object of the specified class and automatically injects the dependencies using the resolve() method. We have registered BMW with ICar above. Now, we can instantiate the Driver class using Unity container without using the new keyword as shown below.
Example: Resolve - C#
 Copy
IUnityContainer container = new UnityContainer();
container.RegisterType<ICar, BMW>();// Map ICar with BMW 

//Resolves dependencies and returns the Driver object 
Driver drv = container.Resolve<Driver>(); 
drv.RunCar();
Output:
Running BMW - 1 mile
In the above example, Unity container creates an object of the Driver class using the container.Resolve<driver>() method. The Driver class is a dependency of ICar. So, container.Resolve<Driver>() returns an object of the Driver class by automatically creating and injecting a BMW object in it. All this is behind the scene. The BMW object is created and injected because we register the BMW type with ICar.
Unity container will create a new object and inject it every time we resolve the same type.
var container = new UnityContainer();
container.RegisterType<ICar, BMW>();

Driver driver1 = container.Resolve<Driver>();
driver1.RunCar();

Driver driver2 = container.Resolve<Driver>();
driver2.RunCar();
Output:
Running BMW - 1 mile
Running BMW - 1 mile
In the above example, container injects the BMW object whenever it resolves the Driver class, e.g. driver1 and driver2 both have references to separate BMW objects.
Thus, you can create an object of the specified type using Unity container. Learn about all the overloads of the Resolve method on MSDN.
Multiple Registration
Unity container will inject the last registered type if you register multiple mappings of the same type.
IUnityContainer container = new UnityContainer();
container.RegisterType<ICar, BMW>();
container.RegisterType<ICar, Audi>();

Driver driver = container.Resolve<Driver>();
driver.RunCar();
Output:
Running Audi - 1 Mile
In the above example, ICar is mapped to both BMW and Audi. However, Unity will inject Audi every time because it has been registered last.
Register Named Type
You can register a type-mapping with a name which you can use with the Resolve() method.
Example: Register Named Type - C#
 Copy
IUnityContainer container = new UnityContainer();
container.RegisterType<ICar, BMW>();
container.RegisterType<ICar, Audi>("LuxuryCar");

ICar bmw = container.Resolve<ICar>();  // returns the BMW object
ICar audi = container.Resolve<ICar>("LuxuryCar"); // returns the Audi object
As you can see above, we have mapped ICar with both the BMW and the Audi class. However, we have given the name "LuxuryCar" to the ICar-Audi mapping. So now, the Resolve() method will return an object of Audi if we specify the mapping name.
Consider the following example:
var container = new UnityContainer();
container.RegisterType<ICar, BMW>();
container.RegisterType<ICar, Audi>("LuxuryCar");

// Registers Driver type            
container.RegisterType<Driver>("LuxuryCarDriver", 
                new InjectionConstructor(container.Resolve<ICar>("LuxuryCar")));

Driver driver1 = container.Resolve<Driver>();// injects BMW
driver1.RunCar();

Driver driver2 = container.Resolve<Driver>("LuxuryCarDriver");// injects Audi
driver2.RunCar();
Output:
Running BMW - 1 Mile
Running Audi - 1 Mile
In the above example, we registered the Driver class with the name "LuxuryCarDriver" and specified an object of InjectionConstructor. The new InjectionConstructor(container.Resolve<ICar>("LuxuryCar")) specifies a construction injection for the Driver class, which passes an object of Audi because container.Resolve("LuxuryCar") returns an Audi object. So now, we can use container.Resolve<Driver>("LuxuryCarDriver") to resolve the Driver with Audi even if ICar is registered with BMW by default.
Register Instance
Unity container allows us to register an existing instance using the RegisterInstance() method. It will not create a new instance for the registered type and we will use the same instance every time.
var container = new UnityContainer();
ICar audi = new Audi();
container.RegisterInstance<ICar>(audi);

Driver driver1 = container.Resolve<Driver>();
driver1.RunCar();
driver1.RunCar();

Driver driver2 = container.Resolve<Driver>();
driver2.RunCar();
Output:
Running Audi - 1 Mile
Running Audi - 2 Mile
Running Audi - 3 Mile
Thus, we can register and resolve different types using Unity container.

Reflection nedir	(GITHUB) (testset)

Reflection in C# is used to retrieve metadata on types at runtime. In other words, you can use reflection to inspect metadata of the types in your program dynamically -- you can retrieve information on the loaded assemblies and the types defined in them. Reflection in C# is similar to RTTI (Runtime Type Information) of C++.

To work with reflection in .Net, you should include the System.Reflection namespace in your program. In using reflection, you get objects of the type "Type" that can be used to represent assemblies, types, or modules. You can use reflection to create an instance of a type dynamically and even invoke methods of the type.

The types defined in the System.Reflection namespace include the following.

Tutorial: Using Entity Framework Core as an In-Memory Database for ASP.NET Core (GITHUB)

One of the most exciting features in the new version of Entity Framework (Entity Framework Core 1.0) is the addition of an in-memory data provider. This makes it possible to prototype applications and write tests without having to set up a local or external database. When you’re ready to switch to using a real database, you can simply swap in your actual provider.
In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to set up the Entity Framework Core InMemory provider and use it to prototype a simple ASP.NET Core API. If you’ve never set up ASP.NET Core before, follow my earlier tutorial on creating a new ASP.NET Core project to create a new API application called PrototypeApi.
Setting up Entity Framework Core
First, add the Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory package to your project. In Visual Studio, you can use the NuGet Package Manager to do this (right-click on the project and choose Manage NuGet Packages). Alternatively, you can edit the project.json file and add this line to the dependencies section:
 
1
2	"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory": "1.0.0"
Use dotnet restore to install the package if you aren’t using Visual Studio.
The API I’ll be demonstrating contains a collection of users and a collection of posts. Create some model classes to represent these entities (in a new folder called DbModels):
DbModels/User.cs

    {
        public string Id { get; set; }
 
        public string FirstName { get; set; }
 
        public string LastName { get; set; }
 
        public List<Post> Posts { get; set; }
    }
}

    {
        public string Id { get; set; }
 
        public string UserId { get; set; }
 
        public User User { get; set; }
 
        public string Content { get; set; }
    }
}
These simple classes will represent the data that will be saved and loaded from the database.
In this data model, there’s a straightforward one-to-many relationship between Users and Posts: a Post is “owned” by a User, and a User may have many Posts. The Posts and User properties will be automatically discovered and populated by Entity Framework Core.
You’ll also need to create a DbContext that represents the connection to the database:

        public DbSet<Post> Posts { get; set; }
    }
}
You’re all set to connect this database context to your application using the in-memory data provider. In your Startup class’ ConfigureServices method, add a new line:
 
1
2
3
4
5
6
7	public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddDbContext<ApiContext>(opt => opt.UseInMemoryDatabase());
 
    services.AddMvc();
}
At the top of the Startup class, add this line:
 
1
2	using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
Seeding With Test Data on Startup
To add data to the in-memory database when the application starts up, add some code to the Configure method:
 
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11	public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env, ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)
{
    loggerFactory.AddConsole(Configuration.GetSection("Logging"));
    loggerFactory.AddDebug();
 
    var context = app.ApplicationServices.GetService<ApiContext>();
    AddTestData(context);
 
    app.UseMvc();
}
The new AddTestData method looks like this:

22
23	private static void AddTestData(ApiContext context)
{
    var testUser1 = new DbModels.User
    {
        Id = "abc123",
        FirstName = "Luke",
        LastName = "Skywalker"
    };
 
    context.Users.Add(testUser1);
 
    var testPost1 = new DbModels.Post
    {
        Id = "def234",
        UserId = testUser1.Id,
        Content = "What a piece of junk!"
    };
 
    context.Posts.Add(testPost1);
 
    context.SaveChanges();
}
Retrieving the Data
Querying and retrieving data from an in-memory provider use the same methods as any Entity Framework Core provider. To demonstrate retrieving the Users and Posts stored in the prototype database, create a simple controller:
Controllers/UsersController.cs

35	using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
 
namespace PrototypeApi.Controllers
{
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    public class UsersController : Controller
    {
        private readonly ApiContext _context;
 
        public UsersController(ApiContext context)
        {
            _context = context;
        }
 
        public async Task<IActionResult> Get()
        {
            var users = await _context.Users
                .Include(u => u.Posts)
                .ToArrayAsync();
 
            var response = users.Select(u => new
            {
                firstName = u.FirstName,
                lastName = u.LastName,
                posts = u.Posts.Select(p => p.Content)
            });
 
            return Ok(response);
        }
    }
}
This does two things: it requests an ApiContext object from the dependency injection service (using constructor injection) and exposes an HTTP GET route that returns all the users (and their posts) currently stored in the database.
In the Get method, the Include method explicitly tells Entity Framework Core to load the User’s Posts along with their other details. Entity Framework Core is smart enough to understand that the UserId field on the Post model represents a foreign key relationship between Users and Posts.
After the users and posts are asynchronously retrieved from the database, the array is projected (using Select) into a response model that includes only the fields you need in the response. This keeps the JSON response minimal.

Try-catch-finally nedir
Try catch nedir

Buradaki “catch” in anlamı hatayı yakalamaktır.

Kendi örneğim:
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;
using CodeInConsole;

namespace CodeInConsole

            var list = new List<string>();
            Console.WriteLine("Begin");

            try
            {
                list.Add("Birinci");
                var s = list.Where(n => n == "").Single();  // exception

            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Error: " + e.Message);
            }

            finally
            {
                if (list.Count == 1)  // yani sadece "Birinci" isimli string listeye eklenmiş ise...
                {
                    list.Clear();
                    Console.WriteLine("HATA! Her iki string'i bir interaction'da " +
                        "ekleyemediğimiz için tüm işlemler geri alındı " +
                        "(listedeki veriler sıfırlanarak liste eski haline getirilmiş oldu).");
                    Console.WriteLine("Listedeki string sayısı: " + list.Count());
                }
                if(list.Count == 2)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("BAŞARILI! Her iki string de listeye eklendi.");
                    Console.WriteLine("Listedeki string sayısı: " + list.Count());
                }
            }

The try..catch..finally block in .NET allows developers to handle runtime exceptions. The syntax has three variations, try..catch, try..finally, and try..catch..finally. Learn more here: Exception Handling in C#
 
The code example shows a try catch finally block syntax. 
1.	try  
2.	{  
3.	//Put suspected code here. When an exception occurs, the control will move to the catch block
4.	}  
5.	catch  
6.	{  
7.	//Catch the exception  
8.	}  
9.	finally  
10.	{  
11.	//this block of code will always get executed whether an  
12.	// exception occurs or not as long as there are no exceptions  
13.	// within this block itself. If an Exception is thrown here  
14.	// some outer try block should handle it  
15.	//Any Clean up code goes here. Especially to release any  
16.	//system resources such as file handles and network  
17.	//connections  
18.	}  
Let's go through an example so that we can better understand the purpose of the finally block. The following code illustrates the use of the finally block to clean up file states. 
1.	namespace TestFinally  
2.	{  
3.	using System;  
4.	using System.IO;  
5.	/// <summary>  
6.	/// Summary description for TestFinally.  
7.	/// </summary>  
8.	public class TestFinally  
9.	{  
10.	public TestFinally()  
11.	{  
12.	// TODO: Add Constructor Logic here  
13.	}  
14.	public static void Main()  
15.	{  
16.	StreamReader sr1 = null;  
17.	StreamWriter sw1 = null;  
18.	try  
19.	{  
20.	System.Console.WriteLine("In try block");  
21.	//Open files  
22.	sr1 = new StreamReader(File.Open("Test1.txt",  
23.	System.IO.FileMode.Open));  
24.	sw1 = new StreamWriter(File.Open("Test2.txt",  
25.	System.IO.FileMode.Append,  
26.	FileAccess.Write));  
27.	while (sr1.Peek() != -1)  
28.	{  
29.	sw1.WriteLine(sr1.ReadLine());  
30.	}  
31.	goto MyLabel;  
32.	}  
33.	catch (Exception e)  
34.	{  
35.	Console.WriteLine(String.Concat(e.Message,  
36.	e.StackTrace));  
37.	}  
38.	finally  
39.	{  
40.	//Int32 j ;  
41.	//j=0;  
42.	//j=j/5;  
43.	//If an Exception is thrown here some outer  
44.	//try block should handle it. The finally block  
45.	// will not be completely executed  
46.	Console.WriteLine("In finally block");  
47.	//we need to make sure that Close method of the  
48.	//Streamreader sr1 or StreamWriter sw1  
49.	//is called irrespective of whether an exception  
50.	// occurs or not  
51.	//to release any system resources associated with  
52.	//the reader or writer  
53.	if (sr1 != null)  
54.	{  
55.	sr1.Close();  
56.	}  
57.	if (sw1 != null)  
58.	{  
59.	sw1.Close();  
60.	}  
61.	}  
62.	MyLabel:  
63.	Console.WriteLine("In Mylabel");  
64.	// note: the following statements are not allowed  
65.	//inside a finally block:  
66.	//return, goto, break and continue  
67.	Console.ReadLine();  
68.	}  
69.	}  
70.	}  
In the above code, inside the Main method, we opened two files. First we opened the Test1.txt using a StreamReader object by passing a FileStream object returned by the File.Open method, and then we opened Test2.txt through a StreamWriter object by passing a FileStream object returned by the File.Open method. The intention here is to copy lines of Test1.txt and append them to Test2.txt. If the code in the try block executes successfully, we want to close StreamReader sr1 and StreamWriter sw1 so that system resources associated with the reader/writer are released.
 
If Test1.txt opens successfully but for some reason there is an exception thrown while opening Test2.txt, we still want to close the stream associated with Test1.txt. So in this example we have added the close methods in the finally code block so that they can be positively executed. We are checking for a null value because if none of the files is opened, we would get a nulldereferencing exception in the finally block.
 
Conclusion
 
Hope this article helped you understand how to use the try..catch..finally block in C#.

Jagged Array (GITHUB)
A jagged array is an array of arrays.
 



Let us understand jagged array with an example
1. There are 3 employees - Mark, Matt, John
2. Mark has a bachelor, master and doctorate degree (3 qualifications)
3. Matt has only a bachelor degree (1 qualification)
4. John has a bachelor and a master degree (2 qualifications)

Different employees have different number of qualifications. To store their qualifications in a data structure, Jagged array is one of the choices.

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        // Create a string array to store the names of the employees
        string[] employeeNames = new string[3];
        employeeNames[0] = "Mark";
        employeeNames[1] = "Matt";
        employeeNames[2] = "John";

        // Create a jagged array. As we want to store varying number of qualifications 
        // and as qualifications are strings, let's create an array of string arrays.
        string[][] jaggedArray = new string[3][];

        // Set the size of the first string array to 3, as we want to store 3 qualifications for Mark
        jaggedArray[0] = new string[3];
        // Set the size of the second string array to 1, as we want to store 
        // only 1 qualification for Matt
        jaggedArray[1] = new string[1];
        // Set the size of the third string array to 2, as we want to store 2 qualifications for John
        jaggedArray[2] = new string[2];

        // Set the values for the first string array
        jaggedArray[0][0] = "Bachelor";
        jaggedArray[0][1] = "Master";
        jaggedArray[0][2] = "Doctorate";
        // Set the values for the second string array
        jaggedArray[1][0] = "Bachelor";
        // Set the values for the thrid string array
        jaggedArray[2][0] = "Bachelor";
        jaggedArray[2][1] = "Master";

        // Loop thru and print out the elements of Jagged array
        for (int i = 0; i < jaggedArray.Length; i++)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(employeeNames[i]);
            Console.WriteLine("--------");
            string[] innerArray = jaggedArray[i];
            for (int j = 0; j < innerArray.Length; j++)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(innerArray[j]);
            }
            Console.WriteLine();
        }
    }
}

In this example, we have created an array of string arrays. In a similar way, we create an array of integer arrays, an array of decimal arrays etc.

What are the default access modifiers in C#? (GITHUB)

Access’ler mini
Kısaca:
top level class: internal
method: private
members (unless an interface or enum): private (including nested classes)
members (of interface or enum): public
constructor: private (note that if no constructor is explicitly defined, a public default constructor will be automatically defined)
delegate: internal
interface: internal
explicitly implemented interface member: public!

Short answer: minimum possible access (cf Jon Skeet's answer).
Long answer:
Non-nested types, enumeration and delegate accessibilities (may only have internal or public accessibility)
                     | Default   | Permitted declared accessibilities
------------------------------------------------------------------
namespace            | public    | none (always implicitly public)

enum                 | public    | public, internal

interface            | internal  | public, internal

class                | internal  | public, internal

struct               | internal  | public, internal

delegate             | internal  | public, internal
Nested type and member accessiblities
                     | Default   | Permitted declared accessibilities
------------------------------------------------------------------

¹ All === public, protected, internal, private, protected internal
² structs cannot inherit from structs or classes (although they can, interfaces), hence protected is not a valid modifier
The accessibility of a nested type depends on its accessibility domain, which is determined by both the declared accessibility of the member and the accessibility domain of the immediately containing type. However, the accessibility domain of a nested type cannot exceed that of the containing type.
Note: CIL also has the provision for protected and internal (as opposed to the existing protected "or" internal), but to my knowledge this is not currently available for use in C#.

Jon Skeet yazısı:
The default access for everything in C# is "the most restricted access you could declare for that member".
So for example:
namespace MyCompany
{
    class Outer
    {
        void Foo() {}
        class Inner {}
    }
}
is equivalent to
namespace MyCompany
{
    internal class Outer
    {
        private void Foo() {}
        private class Inner {}
    }
}
The one sort of exception to this is making one part of a property (usually the setter) more restricted than the declared accessibility of the property itself:
public string Name
{
    get { ... }
    private set { ... } // This isn't the default, have to do it explicitly
}

Business Object	(BSS)	      (BSS)    
Business Object nedir
Business Object: A type of an intelligible entity being an actor inside the business layer in an n-layered architecture of object-oriented computer programs. Whereas a program may implement classes, which typically end in objects managing or executing behaviors, a business object usually does nothing itself but holds a set of instance variables or properties, also known as attributes, and associations with other business objects, weaving a map of objects representing the business relationships.
(galiba business layer’ın çalışma mantığından akılda tutulsa yanlışlık yapılmış olmaz… Business layer neydi, database layer ile presentation layer arasında görev yapan bi aracıydı. Yani iki layer arasında bişeyler yapıyordu. Şu durumda, business layer’da iş gören bi objenin business objesi olması için napabilmesi gerek; diğer layer’larla ilişkili olması gerek. Business object de galiba bu ilişkileri sağlayabilen, bi class’ın objesi… Kaynak gösterilmeli.)

C# - Dynamic Types	(GITHUB)	      (BSS)    
Viewbag nedir, viewbag kullanmalı mıyız
(not: viewbag da dynamic type’dır. Compile-time’da derlenmez. Runtime’da olur olay. O yüzden yazdığın viewbag’da hata falan varsa compile time’da göremezsin. Ve örneğin yazdığın viewbag’ın adı, view kısmında farklı controller kısmında farklı olabilir, bu hata oluşacak demektir. İsmi yanlış yazdığımz halda yine compile time’da hata gösterilmeyeceği için sıkıntı yaşayacağız demektir.
O halde view’a veri yollarken viewbag kullanmamak iyi olur diyor kudvenkat. Peki ne yapacağız? Veri yollarken strongly typed modeller kullanacağız ki bir hata oluşmuşsa compile time’da bu hatayı görebilelim. Yani viewModel kullanacağız. Viewmodel bir strongly typed model’dir çünkü oluşan hataları compile time’da gösterir.)
 
C# 4.0 (.NET 4.5) introduced a new type called dynamic that avoids compile-time type checking. A dynamic type escapes type checking at compile-time; instead, it resolves type at run time.
A dynamic type variables are defined using the dynamic keyword.
Example: dynamic Variable
dynamic MyDynamicVar = 1;
The compiler compiles dynamic types into object types in most cases. However, the actual type of a dynamic type variable would be resolved at run-time.
Example: dynamic Type at run-time
dynamic MyDynamicVar = 1;

Console.WriteLine(MyDynamicVar.GetType());
Output:
System.Int32
Dynamic types change types at run-time based on the assigned value. The following example shows how a dynamic variable changes type based on assigned value.
Example: dynamic
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    dynamic MyDynamicVar = 100;
    Console.WriteLine("Value: {0}, Type: {1}", MyDynamicVar, MyDynamicVar.GetType());

    MyDynamicVar = "Hello World!!";
    Console.WriteLine("Value: {0}, Type: {1}", MyDynamicVar, MyDynamicVar.GetType());

    MyDynamicVar = true;
    Console.WriteLine("Value: {0}, Type: {1}", MyDynamicVar, MyDynamicVar.GetType());

    MyDynamicVar = DateTime.Now;
    Console.WriteLine("Value: {0}, Type: {1}", MyDynamicVar, MyDynamicVar.GetType());
}
Try it
Output:
Value: 100, Type: System.Int32
Value: Hello World!!, Type: System.String
Value: True, Type: System.Boolean
Value: 01-01-2014, Type: System.DateTime
The dynamic type variables is converted to other types implicitly.
Example: dynamic Type Conversion
dynamic d1 = 100;
int i = d1;
		
d1 = "Hello";
string greet = d1;
		
d1 = DateTime.Now;
DateTime dt = d1;
Methods and Parameters
If you assign a class object to the dynamic type, then the compiler would not check for correct methods and properties name of a dynamic type that holds the custom class object. Consider the following example.
Example: Calling Methods
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        dynamic stud = new Student();

        stud.DisplayStudentInfo(1, "Bill");// run-time error, no compile-time error
        stud.DisplayStudentInfo("1");// run-time error, no compile-time error
        stud.FakeMethod();// run-time error, no compile-time error
    }
}

public class Student
{
    public void DisplayStudentInfo(int id)
    {
    }
}
Try it
In the above example, the C# compiler does not check for the number of parameters, parameters type, or non-existent. It validates these things at run-time, and if it is not valid, then throws a run-time exception. Note that Visual Studio IntelliSense is not supported for the dynamic types. Note that Visual Studio IntelliSense is not supported for the dynamic types.
The dynamic language runtime (DLR) API provides the infrastructure that supports the dynamic type in C#. For more information about the DLR, visit Dynamic Language Runtime Overview.

Domain Class,  Domain Object    	(BSS)	      (BSS)    
Domain class nedir

A domain class represents a table column and it allows you to handle the column value as a Java object. In the Doma framework, a domain means all the values which a data type may contain. In short, a domain class is a user defined class that can be map to a column. The use of the domain classes is optional.

A "domain" class is one that models your data. It is typically used to map data from your data store (e.g. a database) to an in-memory object. A business class is one that your application works with. It can be the same as the domain class, and usually performs some sort of business logic or processing.

Persistence refers to the ability of the object state to be saved to some data store (e.g. xml, a text file, or more commonly, a database). So the state of this kind of object "persists" whether the application is running or not.
(business class ile domain class arasında fark yok diyor->) To me, there is no difference with a business class: a business object doesn't perform more or less business logic than a domain object (a domain model where business logic is implemented outside the domain objects is called an Anemic Domain Model, which is a pejorative term), domain objects and business objects are the same thing.

Using a mapping tool such as AutoMapper will do the mapping of the domain object to the Entity object, or you can code that separately if desired.

Object Model   	(GITHUB)	      (BSS)    
Object model nedir

In LINQ to SQL, an object model in your own programming language is mapped to a relational database.
An object model is a logical interface, software or system that is modeled through the use of object-oriented techniques. It enables the creation of an architectural software or system model prior to development or programming.
An object model is part of the object-oriented programming (OOP) lifecycle.
Techopedia explains Object Model
An object model helps describe or define a software/system in terms of objects and classes. It defines the interfaces or interactions between different models, inheritance, encapsulation and other object-oriented interfaces and features.

Object model examples include:

•	Document Object Model (DOM): A set of objects that provides a modeled representation of dynamic HTML and XHTML-based Web pages
•	Component Object Model (COM): A proprietary Microsoft software architecture used to create software components

Anemic Domain Model, Rich Domain Model (GITHUB)


Anemic domain model = database tables mapped to objects (only field values, no real behavior)
Rich domain model = a collection of objects that expose behavior
If you want to create a simple CRUD application, maybe an anemic model with a classic MVC framework is enough. But if you want to implement some kind of logic, anemic model means that you will not do object oriented programming.
*Note that object behavior has nothing to do with persistence. A different layer (Data Mappers, Repositories e.t.c.) is responsible for persisting domain objects.

Anemic domain model is the use of a software domain model where the domain objects contain little or no business logic (validations, calculations, business rules etc.).

N Tier(Multi-Tier), 3-Tier, 2-Tier Architecture with EXAMPLE
What is N-Tier?
An N-Tier Application program is one that is distributed among three or more separate computers in a distributed network.
The most common form of n-tier is the 3-tier Application, and it is classified into three categories.
•	User interface programming in the user's computer
•	Business logic in a more centralized computer, and
•	Required data in a computer that manages a database.
This architecture model provides Software Developers to create Reusable application/systems with maximum flexibility.
In N-tier, "N" refers to a number of tiers or layers are being used like – 2-tier, 3-tier or 4-tier, etc. It is also called “Multi-Tier Architecture”.
The n-tier architecture is an industry-proven software architecture model. It is suitable to support enterprise level client-server applications by providing solutions to scalability, security, fault tolerance, reusability, and maintainability. It helps developers to create flexible and reusable applications. 
N-Tier Architecture
A diagrammatic representation of an n-tier system depicts here – presentation, application, and database layers.
 N Tier Architecture Diagram
These three layers can be further subdivided into different sub-layers depending on the requirements.
Some of the popular sites who have applied this architecture are
•	MakeMyTrip.com
•	Sales Force enterprise application
•	Indian Railways – IRCTC
•	Amazon.com, etc.
Some common terms to remember, so as to understand the concept more clearly.
•	Distributed Network: It is a network architecture, where the components located at network computers coordinate and communicate their actions only by passing messages. It is a collection of multiple systems situated at different nodes but appears to the user as a single system.
o	It provides a single data communication network which can be managed separately by different networks.
o	An example of Distributed Network– where different clients are connected within LAN architecture on one side and on the other side they are connected to high-speed switches along with a rack of servers containing service nodes.
•	Client-Server Architecture: It is an architecture model where the client (one program) requests a service from a server (another program) i.e. It is a request-response service provided over the internet or through an intranet.
In this model, Client will serve as one set of program/code which executes a set of actions over the network. While Server, on the other hand, is a set of another program, which sends the result sets to the client system as requested.
o	In this, client computer provides an interface to an end user to request a service or a resource from a server and on the other hand server then processes the request and displays the result to the end user.
o	An example of Client-Server Model– an ATM machine. A bank is the server for processing the application within the large customer databases and ATM machine is the client having a user interface with some simple application processing.
•	Platform: In computer science or software industry, a platform is a system on which applications program can run. It consists of a combination of hardware and software that have a built-in instruction for a processors/microprocessors to perform specific operations.
o	In more simple words, the platform is a system or a base where any applications can run and execute to obtain a specific task.
o	An example of Platform – A personal machine loaded with Windows 2000 or Mac OS X as examples of 2 different platforms. (platform nedir)
•	Database: It is a collection of information in an organized way so that it can be easily accessed, managed and updated.
o	Examples of Database – MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle Database are some common Db's.
Types of N-Tier Architectures
There are different types of N-Tier Architectures, like 3-tier Architecture, 2-Tier Architecture and 1- Tier Architecture.
First, we will see 3-tier Architecture, which is very important.
3-Tier Architecture
By looking at the below diagram, you can easily identify that 3-tier architecture has three different layers.
•	Presentation layer
•	Business Logic layer
•	Database layer
 
3 Tier Architecture Diagram
Here we have taken a simple example of student form to understand all these three layers. It has information about a student like – Name, Address, Email, and Picture.
User Interface Layer or Presentation Layer
 
Presentation Layer
private void DataGrid1_SelectedIndexChanged(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
// Object of the Property layer
clsStudent objproperty=new clsStudent();
// Object of the business layer
clsStudentInfo objbs=new clsStudentInfo();
// Object of the dataset in which we receive the data sent by the business layer
DataSet ds=new DataSet();
// here we are placing the value in the property using the object of the
//property layer
objproperty.id=int.Parse(DataGridl.SelectedItem.Cells[1].Text.ToString());

// In this following code we are calling a function from the business layer and 
// passing the object of the property layer which will carry the ID till the database.
ds=objbs.GetAllStudentBsIDWise(objproperty);

// What ever the data has been returned by the above function into the dataset
//is being populate through the presentation laye.
txtId.Text=ds.Tables[0].Rows[0][0].ToString();
txtFname.Text=ds.Tables[0].Rows[0][1].ToString();
txtAddress.Text=ds.Tables[0].Rows[0][2].ToString();
txtemail.Text=ds.Tables[0].Rows[0][3].ToString();
Code Explanation
•	The above code defines the basic designing of a front end view of applications as well as calling of the functions of other layers so that they can be integrated with each other.
Business Access Layer -
This is the function of the business layer which accepts the data from the application layer and passes it to the data layer.
•	Business logic acts as an interface between Client layer and Data Access Layer
•	All business logic – like validation of data, calculations, data insertion/modification are written under business logic layer.
•	It makes communication faster and easier between the client and data layer
•	Defines a proper workflow activity that is necessary to complete a task.
// this is the function of the business layer which accepts the data from the 
//application layer and passes it to the data layer.
public class clsStudentInfo (bir business layer metodu)
{
	public DataSet GetAllStudentBsIDWise(clsStudent obj)   (application layer’dan   veri alınıyor [bkz parametreye argüman olarak] ve bu very dönülüyor.)
	{
	 DataSet ds=new DataSet();
	 ds=objdt.getdata_dtIDWise(obj);// Calling of Data layer function (burada da data layer ile ilişki kuruluyor)
	 return ds;
	}
}

Explanation of code
The code is using the function of business layer, which will accept the data for the application layer and passed it to the data layer. The Business layer codes act as a mediator between the functions defined in the presentation layer and data layer and calling the functions vice -versa.
Data Access Layer
This is the data layer function, which receives the data from the business layer and performs the necessary operation into the database.
// this is the datalayer function which is receiving the data from the business 
//layer and performing the required operation into the database

public class clsStudentData // Data layer class 
{
	// object of property layer class
	public DataSet getdata_dtIDUise(clsStudent obj)
	{
	 DataSet ds;
	 string sql;
	 sql="select * from student where Studentld=" +obj.id+ "order by Studentld;
	 ds=new DataSet();
	//this is the datalayer function which accepts the sql query and performs the 
	//corresponding operation
		ds=objdt.ExecuteSql(sql); 
		return ds;
	}
}
Explanation of code
The code defines in dataset layer above accepts the entire request: requested by the system and performing the required operations into the database.
2-Tier Architecture:
It is like Client-Server architecture, where communication takes place between client and server.
In this type of software architecture, the presentation layer or user interface layer runs on the client side while dataset layer gets executed and stored on server side.
There is no Business logic layer or immediate layer in between client and server.
Single Tier or 1-Tier Architecture:
It is the simplest one as it is equivalent to running the application on the personal computer. All of the required components for an application to run are on a single application or server.
Presentation layer, Business logic layer, and data layer are all located on a single machine.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Multi-Tier Architectures
Advantages	Disadvantages
•	Scalability	•	Increase in Effort
•	Data Integrity	•	Increase in Complexity
•	Reusability	 
•	Reduced Distribution	 
•	Improved Security	 
•	Improved Availability	 
Hence, it is a part of a program which encrypts real-world business problems and determines how data can be updated, created, stored, or changed to get the complete task done.
N-Tier Architecture Tips and Development
Considering the software professionals must have a full control on all the layers of the architecture, tips on n-tier architecture are given as below
1.	Try to decouple layers from another layer as much as possible by using a technique like soap XML.
2.	Use some automated tools to generate a mapping between a business logic layer and a relational database layer (data layer). Tools that can help in modeling these mapping techniques are – Entity Framework and Hibernate for .Net etc.
3.	In client presenter layer, put a common code for all the clients in a separate library as much as possible. This will maximize the code reusability for all types of clients.
4.	A cache layer can be added into an existing layer to speed up the performance.
Summary:
The N-tier architecture helps to manage all the components (business layer, presentation layer, and database layer) of an application under one roof.
Applications thatuses small numbers of users on a local area network can benefit from n-tier architecture.
Such architectural design ascertains maintaining, scaling up and deploying an application on the Internet efficiently.

LINQ - LINQ extension methods   	(GITHUB)	      (asd)    
linq nedir, LINQ nedir, LINQ extension method nedir, LINQ extension methods nedir
I find that if you're familiar with SQL syntax, using the LINQ query syntax is much clearer, more natural, and makes it easier to spot errors:
var id = 1;
var query =
   from post in database.Posts
   join meta in database.Post_Metas on post.ID equals meta.Post_ID
   where post.ID == id
   select new { Post = post, Meta = meta };

If you're really stuck on using lambdas though, your syntax is quite a bit off. Here's the same query, using the LINQ extension methods:
var id = 1;
var query = database.Posts    // your starting point - table in the "from" statement
   .Join(database.Post_Metas, // the source table of the inner join
      post => post.ID,        // Select the primary key (the first part of the "on" clause in an sql "join" statement)
      meta => meta.Post_ID,   // Select the foreign key (the second part of the "on" clause)
      (post, meta) => new { Post = post, Meta = meta }) // selection
   .Where(postAndMeta => postAndMeta.Post.ID == id);    // where statement

Context   	(GITHUB)	      (BSS)    
context nedir
Defines an environment for the objects that are resident inside it and for which a policy can be enforced.
-
Something is typically called a "context" in computer programming when that something encapsulates some kind of state.
In the example of Linq 2 sql or EF, you have a Data Context, or Object Context.. these encapsulate the state of your data model, including connections and versioning.
In the case of HttpContext, it's encapsulating the state of an Http connection (which is normally considered stateless, but HttpContext tries to give state to it).
In english, if we refer to context, we refer to information surrounding something that allows you to understand the entire situation in which that something exists. For example, we may say a statement is "taken out of context". That would mean a statement by itself doesn't necessarily reveal all the information.
Out of context:
People are tasty.
In Context:
We should never say or think that people are tasty.
Without the "context", the statement has a different meaning. Programming has taken the term to similarly refer to the data surrounding something that gives it more meaning.

Fluent API    	(BSS)	      (BSS)    
Data annotations nedir, fluent api nedir, fluent nedir
Fluent API is an advanced way of specifying model configuration that covers everything that data annotations can do in addition to some more advanced configuration not possible with data annotations. Data annotations and the fluent API can be used together, but Code First gives precedence to Fluent API > data annotations > default conventions.
•	Fluent API is another way to configure your domain classes.
•	The Code First Fluent API is most commonly accessed by overriding the OnModelCreating method on your derived DbContext.
•	Fluent API provides more functionality for configuration than DataAnnotations. Fluent API supports the following types of mappings.
In this chapter, we will continue with the simple example which contains Student, Course and Enrollment classes and one context class with MyContext name as shown in the following code.
using System.Data.Entity; 
using System.Linq; 
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;  

namespace EFCodeFirstDemo {

   class Program {
      static void Main(string[] args) {}
   }
   
   public enum Grade {
      A, B, C, D, F
   }

   public class Enrollment {
      public int EnrollmentID { get; set; }
      public int CourseID { get; set; }
      public int StudentID { get; set; }
      public Grade? Grade { get; set; }
		
      public virtual Course Course { get; set; }
      public virtual Student Student { get; set; }
   }

   public class Student {
      public int ID { get; set; }
      public string LastName { get; set; }
      public string FirstMidName { get; set; }
		
      public DateTime EnrollmentDate { get; set; }
		
      public virtual ICollection<Enrollment> Enrollments { get; set; }
   }

   public class Course {
      public int CourseID { get; set; }
      public string Title { get; set; }
      public int Credits { get; set; }
		
      public virtual ICollection<Enrollment> Enrollments { get; set; }
   }

   public class MyContext : DbContext {
      public virtual DbSet<Course> Courses { get; set; }
      public virtual DbSet<Enrollment> Enrollments { get; set; }
      public virtual DbSet<Student> Students { get; set; }
   }

}	  
To access Fluent API you need to override the OnModelCreating method in DbContext. Let’s take a look at a simple example in which we will rename the column name in student table from FirstMidName to FirstName as shown in the following code.
public class MyContext : DbContext {

   protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder) {
      modelBuilder.Entity<Student>().Property(s ⇒ s.FirstMidName)
      .HasColumnName("FirstName");}

      public virtual DbSet<Course> Courses { get; set; }
      public virtual DbSet<Enrollment> Enrollments { get; set; }
      public virtual DbSet<Student> Students { get; set; }
}
DbModelBuilder is used to map CLR classes to a database schema. It is the main class and on which you can configure all your domain classes. This code centric approach to building an Entity Data Model (EDM) is known as Code First.

Transient Errors Are Evil – How to Handle them With Exponential Backoff in C#	(BSS)	      (BSS)    
February 26, 2016//  by Deb Haldar//  0 Comments
      Transient errors are intermittent errors caused by a short lived outage of a specific resource or service. For example, a network route might be unavailable for a few seconds or milliseconds, a web service may be experiencing high load and sending intermittent HTTP 503-Service unavailable messages or a database you’re trying to access might be in the process of being moved to a different server and hence unavailable for a few seconds.
 
For many transient errors, it makes sense back-off and retry the current operation after waiting a few seconds. The back-off strategy employed could be one of the following:
•	Retry Immediately: Retry the failed operation immediately without waiting.
•	Retry at Fixed Intervals: Retry the failed operation after waiting a fixed amount of time. That is, the wait period between subsequent retries is fixed.
•	Retry with Exponential Back-Off: Exponentially increase the wait time between subsequent retries. Eg. Retry after waiting 2, 4, 8, 16, 32… seconds etc.
•	
Why Exponential Backoff ?
Exponential back-off is super critical when communicating with any web service or any cloud based service like Windows Azure. If the cloud service provider is already experiencing transient issues, immediate retries from multiple client code tends to further worsen the situation. Sometimes this overload of requests leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) type situation for the service. To guard against such situations, many services will throttle clients who makes too many requests within a certain span of time. Using an exponential back-off ensures that each client calling into the service code gives enough breathing room for the service to recover.
 
Some exponential back-off algorithms also adds a randomly calculated delta to the back-off time. This ensures that if many clients are using the same back-off algorithm, their retry times have a lower probability of coinciding. For example, instead of using just the raw exponential backoff time which retries at 2, 4, 8, 16 seconds etc, the formula adds a random +/- 20% delta such that the back-off might happen at 1.7, 4.2, 8.5, 15.4 seconds
So how do we Implement it Retry with Exponential Backoff ?
I’m going to show you three ways of incorporating exponential back-off in any code where retries are needed. This post will detail the use of a home grown retry logic with exponential back off that I’ve been using for a while. Subsequent posts will show how to do this via readily available libraries in a more sophisticated way. The benefit of using the home grown recipe is that you do not need to install any additional dependencies. Just copy paste the code snippet below and you’re all set.
Scenario:
We’re going to request the homepage of https://microsoft.sharepoint.com . This page requires a valid claims token – so the request I going to throw a HTTP 403 – Forbidden response. This response, while expected in this case is a nice way to simulate errors which we can retry.
Client code requirements:
We need to try the operation 3 times. The code should back off exponentially, i.e., the wait time between retries should increase exponentially. Eg. The first retry happens after 2 seconds, the second after 4 seconds, the third after 8 seconds and so on.
 
Client Code
The following code below creates the HTTP Request:
    static void ExecuteHTTPGet(string requestUri)
    {
        HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(requestUri);
        request.KeepAlive = false;
        request.Method = "GET";

        // This line will throw an exception if the HTTP GET fails
        HttpWebResponse webResponse = (HttpWebResponse)request.GetResponse();
        int requestStatus = (int)webResponse.StatusCode;
        webResponse.Close();
    }
Notice that we’re not catching any exception that might be thrown by the client. Catching the exception and retrying the operation will be delegated to our Retry logic.

Custom Retry Logic With Exponential Backoff
  // Enum representing the back-off strategy to use. Required parameter for DoActionWithRetry()
  enum BackOffStrategy
    {
        Linear = 1,
        Exponential = 2
    }

// Retry a specific codeblock wrapped in an Action delegate
static void DoActionWithRetry(Action action, int maxRetries, int waitBetweenRetrySec, BackOffStrategy retryStrategy)
    {
        if (action == null)
        {
            throw new ArgumentNullException("No action specified");
        }

        int retryCount = 1;
        while(retryCount <= maxRetries)
        {
            try
            {
                action();
                break;
            }
            catch(Exception ex)
            {
                if (maxRetries <= 0)
                {
                    throw;
                }
                else
                {
                    //Maybe Log the number of retries
                    Console.WriteLine("Encountered exception {0}, retrying operation", ex.ToString());
                        
                    TimeSpan sleepTime;
                    if(retryStrategy == BackOffStrategy.Linear)
                    {
                        //Wait time is Fixed
                        sleepTime = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(waitBetweenRetrySec);
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        //Wait time increases exponentially
                        sleepTime = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(Math.Pow(waitBetweenRetrySec, retryCount));
                    }
                        
                    Thread.Sleep(sleepTime);

                    retryCount++;
                }
            }
        } 
    }
Here we first define an enum to specify the back-off strategies available. Based on the values in this enum, we’ve structured the code inside the catch() block of DoActionWithRetry() to modify the wait time for each subsequent retry. Notice how the formula uses a combination of retryCount and the base wait time specified to calculate the exponential wait time.

  //Wait time increases exponentially
  sleepTime = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(Math.Pow(waitBetweenRetrySec, retryCount));

Putting it all together
So now that we have the operation we want to execute and a generic retry block, let’s use them in our main function:
 
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        try
        {
            DoActionWithRetry(() =>
                {
                    ExecuteHTTPGet("https://microsoft.sharepoint.com");
                }, 3, 5, BackOffStrategy.Exponential);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            //At this point you can either log the error or log the error and rethrow the exception, depending on your requirements
            Console.WriteLine("Exhausted all retries - exiting program");
            throw; 
        }

    }
The code will retry the HTTP GET request on the url for 3 times and will throw an exception if it encounters a failure the fourth time around. When the number of retries has been exhausted, it’s typically recommended to log the exception and then terminate the thread/ application.
And that’s it !!!
Stay tuned for the next post which’ll show how to do this in a fancier way

Intercept Database Command in Entity Framework (GITHUB)
Here, you will learn how to intercept database commands executed by DbContext in EF 6 database-first, as well as code-first approach.
EF 6 provides the ability to intercept the context by implementing the IDbCommandInterceptor interface. The IDbCommandInterceptor interface includes methods which intercept an instance of DbContext and allow you to execute your custom logic before or after a context executes commands or queries. The DbContext executes commands and queries using ADO.NET methods such as ExecuteNonQuery, ExecuteScalar, and ExecuteReader, which you can intercept by implementing methods such as NonQueryExecuted and NonQueryExecuting etc.
To intercept an instance of DbContext, first, create the custom class and implement IDbCommandInterceptor, as shown below:
class EFCommandInterceptor: IDbCommandInterceptor
{
    public void NonQueryExecuted(System.Data.Common.DbCommand command, DbCommandInterceptionContext<int> interceptionContext)
    {
        LogInfo("NonQueryExecuted", String.Format(" IsAsync: {0}, Command Text: {1}", interceptionContext.IsAsync, command.CommandText));
    }

    public void NonQueryExecuting(System.Data.Common.DbCommand command, DbCommandInterceptionContext<int> interceptionContext)
    {
        LogInfo("NonQueryExecuting", String.Format(" IsAsync: {0}, Command Text: {1}", interceptionContext.IsAsync,  command.CommandText));
    }

    public void ReaderExecuted(System.Data.Common.DbCommand command, DbCommandInterceptionContext<System.Data.Common.DbDataReader> interceptionContext)
    {
        LogInfo("ReaderExecuted", String.Format(" IsAsync: {0}, Command Text: {1}", interceptionContext.IsAsync, command.CommandText));
    }

    public void ReaderExecuting(System.Data.Common.DbCommand command, DbCommandInterceptionContext<System.Data.Common.DbDataReader> interceptionContext)
    {
        LogInfo("ReaderExecuting", String.Format(" IsAsync: {0}, Command Text: {1}", interceptionContext.IsAsync, command.CommandText));
    }

    public void ScalarExecuted(System.Data.Common.DbCommand command, DbCommandInterceptionContext<object> interceptionContext)
    {
        LogInfo("ScalarExecuted", String.Format(" IsAsync: {0}, Command Text: {1}", interceptionContext.IsAsync, command.CommandText));
    }

    public void ScalarExecuting(System.Data.Common.DbCommand command, DbCommandInterceptionContext<object> interceptionContext)
    {
        LogInfo("ScalarExecuting", String.Format(" IsAsync: {0}, Command Text: {1}", interceptionContext.IsAsync, command.CommandText));
    }

    private void LogInfo(string command, string commandText)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Intercepted on: {0} :- {1} ", command, commandText);
    }
}
As you can see in the above example, IDbCommandInterceptor provides six methods for implementation. It logs the command for demo purposes, but you can write your custom logic here.
Next, you will need to configure the interceptor either by using a config file or code-based configuration.
Configure the interceptor in app.config file, as shown below:
<entityFramework>
    <interceptors>
        <interceptor type="EF6DBFirstTutorials.EFCommandInterceptor, EF6DBFirstTutorials">
        </interceptor>
    </interceptors>
</entityFramework>
If you use code-based configuration, then configure it as shown below.
public class FE6CodeConfig : DbConfiguration
{
    public FE6CodeConfig()
    {
        this.AddInterceptor(new EFCommandInterceptor());
    }
}
So now, we can log commands whenever an instance DbContext executes a command or query. Consider the following example.
var newStudent =  new Student() { FirstName = "Bill" };

using (var context = new SchoolDBEntities())
{
    context.Students.Add(newStudent);
    context.SaveChanges();
}
The above example will log the following.
Output:
Intercepted on: ReaderExecuting :- IsAsync: False, Command Text: INSERT [dbo].[Student]([FirstName], [StandardId], [LastName])
VALUES (@0, NULL, NULL)
SELECT [StudentID], [RowVersion] FROM [dbo].[Student]
WHERE @@ROWCOUNT > 0 AND [StudentID] = scope_identity()
Intercepted on: ReaderExecuted :- IsAsync: False, Command Text: INSERT [dbo].[Student]([FirstName], [StandardId], [LastName])
VALUES (@0, NULL, NULL)
SELECT [StudentID], [RowVersion] FROM [dbo].[Student]
WHERE @@ROWCOUNT > 0 AND [StudentID] = scope_identity()

MULTI TENANCY - MULTI TENANT   	(GITHUB)	      (asd)    
multi tenant nedir, multi tenancy nedir, multitenant nedir, multi-tenant nedir
What are the advantages of a multi-tenancy SaaS architecture? How does it differ from single tenant instances? We break down the differences and highlight the benefits of implementing a SaaS solution for data protection in this blog.
MULTI-TENANCY – A CORE BENEFIT OF SAAS
In the early days of the cloud, organizations were reluctant to adopt cloud strategies. Few organizations considered applying policies, technologies, and controls to protect data across the cloud. The last several years, which has seen the proven effectiveness of cloud deployments in scalability, cost, and security, has changed that however. Now we’re seeing the rapid adoption of cloud platforms by organizations of all shapes and sizes.
Digital Guardian’s Data Protection Platform leverages software as a service, or SaaS, to provide data protection in a package that results in superior security, better economics, and reduced overhead. One of the ways we do this is through multi-tenant architecture.

SINGLE TENANT VS MULTI-TENANT – LEARN THE DIFFERENCE
Single Tenant – A single instance of the software and supporting infrastructure serve a single customer. With single tenancy, each customer has his or her own independent database and instance of the software. Essentially, there is no sharing happening with this option.
Potential benefits of single-tenant include:
•	Security: A single customer and a single server is often contained on secure hardware being used by a limited number of people.
•	Dependability: With an entire environment dedicated to one client, resources are abundant and available anytime.
•	Customization: Control over the entire environment allows for customization and added functionality, if desired.
Potential drawbacks of single-tenant:
•	Maintenance: Single-tenant typically means more tasks and regular maintenance to keep things running smoothly and efficiently.
•	Setup/Management: By comparison, SaaS multi-tenant environments are quick to setup and manage.
•	Cost: Single-tenant typically allows for more resources, but at a premium price given that there is only one customer for the entire environment.
Multi-Tenant – Multi-tenancy means that a single instance of the software and its supporting infrastructure serves multiple customers. Each customer shares the software application and also shares a single database. Each tenant’s data is isolated and remains invisible to other tenants.
Potential benefits of multi-tenant:
•	Affordable Cost: Multiple customers means that the cost for the environment is shared, and those savings (from the SaaS vendor) are typically transferred to the cost of the software.
•	Integrations: Cloud environments allow for easier integration with other applications through the use of APIs.
•	“Hands-free” Maintenance: The server technically belongs to the SaaS vendor, meaning that a certain level of database maintenance is handled by the vendor, instead of you maintaining the environment yourself.
Potential drawbacks of multi-tenant:
•	Limited Management/Customization: While you do have added integration benefits, custom changes to the database aren’t typically an option.
•	Security: Other tenants won’t see your data. However, multiple users (not associated with your organization) are allowed on the same database. This broader access reduces control of security.
•	Updates/Changes: If you’re reliant on integrations with other SaaS products and one updates their system, it may cause issues with those connecting apps.

BENEFITS OF SAAS MULTI-TENANT ARCHITECTURE
•	Lower costs through economies of scale: With multi-tenancy, scaling has far fewer infrastructure implications than with a single-tenancy-hosted solution because new users get access to the same basic software.
•	Shared infrastructure leads to lower costs: SaaS allows companies of all sizes to share infrastructure and data center operational costs. There is no need to add applications and more hardware to their environment. Not having to provision or manage any infrastructure or software above and beyond internal resources enables businesses to focus on everyday tasks.
•	Ongoing maintenance and updates: Customers don’t need to pay costly maintenance fees to keep their software up to date. Vendors roll out new features and updates. These are often included with a SaaS subscription.
•	Configuration can be done while leaving the underlying codebase unchanged: Single-tenant-hosted solutions are often customized, requiring changes to an application’s code. This customization can be costly and can make upgrades time-consuming because the upgrade might not be compatible with your environment.
Multi-tenant solutions are designed to be highly configurable so that businesses can make the application perform the way they want. There is no changing the code or data structure, making the upgrade process easy.
Multi-tenancy architecture also allows Digital Guardian to efficiently service everyone from small customers, whose scale may not warrant dedicated infrastructure, to large enterprises that need access to the cloud’s virtually unlimited compute resources. Software development and maintenance costs are shared, driving down expenditures, resulting in savings that are passed onto you, the customers.

Functional Programming For The Rest of Us (GITHUB)
Functional programming nedir
A Walk In The Park
Fire up the time machine. Our walk in the park took place more than two thousand years ago, on a beautiful sunny day of a long forgotten spring in 380 B.C. Outside the city walls of Athens, under the pleasant shade of olive trees Plato was walking towards the Academy with a beautiful slave boy. The weather was lovely, the dinner was filling, and the conversation turned to philosophy.
"Look at these two students", said Plato carefully picking words to make the question educational. "Who do you think is taller?" The slave boy looked towards the basin of water where two men were standing. "They're about the same height", he said. "What do you mean 'about the same'?", asked Plato. "Well, they look the same from here but I'm sure if I were to get closer I'd see that there is some difference."
Plato smiled. He was leading the boy in the right direction. "So you would say that there is nothing perfectly equal in our world?" After some thinking the boy replied: "I don't think so. Everything is at least a little different, even if we can't see it." The point hit home! "Then if nothing is perfectly equal in this world, how do you think you understand the concept of 'perfect' equality?" The slave boy looked puzzled. "I don't know", he replied.
So was born the first attempt to understand the nature of mathematics. Plato suggested that everything in our world is just an approximation of perfection. He also realized that we understand the concept of perfection even though we never encountered it. He came to conclusion that perfect mathematical forms must live in another world and that we somehow know about them by having a connection to that "alternative" universe. It's fairly clear that there is no perfect circle that we can observe. But we also understand what a perfect circle is and can describe it via equations. What is mathematics, then? Why is the universe described with mathematical laws? Can all of the phenomena of our universe be described by mathematics?2
Philosophy of mathematics is a very complex subject. Like most philosophical disciplines it is far more adept at posing questions rather than providing answers. Much of the consensus revolves around the fact that mathematics is really a puzzle: we set up a set of basic non-conflicting principles and a set of rules on how to operate with these principles. We can then stack these rules together to come up with more complex rules. Mathematicians call this method a "formal system" or a "calculus". We can effectively write a formal system for Tetris if we wanted to. In fact, a working implementation of Tetris is a formal system, just specified using an unusual representation.
A civilization of furry creatures on Alpha Centauri would not be able to read our formalisms of Tetris and circles because their only sensory input might be an organ that senses smells. They likely will never find out about the Tetris formalism, but they very well might have a formalism for circles. We probably wouldn't be able to read it because our sense of smell isn't that sophisticated, but once you get past the representation of the formalism (via various sensory instruments and standard code breaking techniques to understand the language), the concepts underneath are understandable to any intelligent civilization.
Interestingly if no intelligent civilization ever existed in the universe the formalisms for Tetris and circles would still hold water, it's just that nobody would be around to find out about them. If an intelligent civilization popped up, it would likely discover some formalisms that help describe the laws of our universe. They also would be very unlikely to ever find out about Tetris because there is nothing in the universe that resembles it. Tetris is one of countless examples of a formal system, a puzzle, that has nothing to do with the real world. We can't even be sure that natural numbers have full resemblance to the real world, after all one can easily think of a number so big that it cannot describe anything in our universe since it might actually turn out to be finite.

A Bit of History3
Let's shift gears in our time machine. This time we'll travel a lot closer, to the 1930s. The Great Depression was ravaging the New and the Old worlds. Almost every family from every social class was affected by the tremendous economic downturn. Very few sanctuaries remained where people were safe from the perils of poverty. Few people were fortunate enough to be in these sanctuaries, but they did exist. Our interest lies in mathematicians in Princeton University.
The new offices constructed in gothic style gave Princeton an aura of a safe haven. Logicians from all over the world were invited to Princeton to build out a new department. While most of America couldn't find a piece of bread for dinner, high ceilings, walls covered with elaborately carved wood, daily discussions by a cup of tea, and walks in the forest were some of the conditions in Princeton.
One mathematician living in such lavish lifestyle was a young man named Alonzo Church. Alonzo received a B.S. degree from Princeton and was persuaded to stay for graduate school. Alonzo felt the architecture was fancier than necessary. He rarely showed up to discuss mathematics with a cup of tea and he didn't enjoy the walks in the woods. Alonzo was a loner: he was most productive when working on his own. Nevertheless Alonzo had regular contacts with other Princeton inhabitants. Among them were Alan Turing, John von Neumann, and Kurt Gödel.
The four men were interested in formal systems. They didn't pay much heed to the physical world, they were interested in dealing with abstract mathematical puzzles instead. Their puzzles had something in common: the men were working on answering questions about computation. If we had machines that had infinite computational power, what problems would we be able to solve? Could we solve them automatically? Could some problems remain unsolved and why? Would various machines with different designs be equal in power?
In cooperation with other men Alonzo Church developed a formal system called lambda calculus. The system was essentially a programming language for one of these imaginary machines. It was based on functions that took other functions as parameters and returned functions as results. The function was identified by a Greek letter lambda, hence the system's name4. Using this formalism Alonzo was able to reason about many of the above questions and provide conclusive answers.
Independently of Alonzo Church, Alan Turing was performing similar work. He developed a different formalism (now referred to as the Turing machine), and used it to independently come to similar conclusions as Alonzo. Later it was shown that Turing machines and lambda calculus were equivalent in power.
This is where the story would stop, I'd wrap up the article, and you'd navigate to another page, if not for the beginning of World War II. The world was in flames. The U.S. Army and Navy used artillery more often than ever. In attempts to improve accuracy the Army employed a large group of mathematicians to continuously calculate differential equations required for solving ballistic firing tables. It was becoming obvious that the task was too great for being solved manually and various equipment was developed in order to overcome this problem. The first machine to solve ballistic tables was a Mark I built by IBM - it weighed five tons, had 750,000 parts and could do three operations per second.
The race, of course, wasn't over. In 1949 an Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer (EDVAC) was unveiled and had tremendous success. It was a first example of von Neumann's architecture and was effectively a real world implementation of a Turing machine. For the time being Alonzo Church was out of luck.
In late 1950s an MIT professor John McCarthy (also a Princeton graduate) developed interest in Alonzo Church's work. In 1958 he unveiled a List Processing language (Lisp). Lisp was an implementation of Alonzo's lambda calculus that worked on von Neumann computers! Many computer scientists recognized the expressive power of Lisp. In 1973 a group of programmers at MIT's Artificial Intelligence Lab developed hardware they called a Lisp machine - effectively a native hardware implementation of Alonzo's lambda calculus!

Functional Programming
Functional programming is a practical implementation of Alonzo Church's ideas. Not all lambda calculus ideas transform to practice because lambda calculus was not designed to work under physical limitations. Therefore, like object oriented programming, functional programming is a set of ideas, not a set of strict guidelines. There are many functional programming languages, and most of them do many things very differently. In this article I will explain the most widely used ideas from functional languages using examples written in Java (yes, you could write functional programs in Java if you felt particularly masochistic). In the next couple of sections we'll take Java as is, and will make modifications to it to transform it into a useable functional language. Let's begin our quest.
Lambda calculus was designed to investigate problems related to calculation. Functional programming, therefore, primarily deals with calculation, and, surprisingly, uses functions to do so. A function is a very basic unit in functional programming. Functions are used for almost everything, even the simplest of calculations. Even variables are replaced with functions. In functional programming variables are simply aliases for expressions (so we don't have to type everything on one line). They cannot be modified. All variables can only be assigned to once. In Java terms this means that every single variable is declared as final (or const if we're dealing with C++). There are no non-final variables in FP.
final int i = 5;
final int j = i + 3;
Since every variable in FP is final two fairly interesting statements can be made. It does not make sense to always write the keyword final and it does not make sense to call variables, well... variables. We will now make two modifications to Java: every variable declared in our functional Java will be final by default, and we will refer to variables as symbols.
By now you are probably wondering how you could possibly write anything reasonably complicated in our newly created language. If every symbol is non-mutable we cannot change the state of anything! This isn't strictly true. When Alonzo was working on lambda calculus he wasn't interested in maintaining state over periods of time in order to modify it later. He was interested in performing operations on data (also commonly referred to as "calculating stuff"). However, it was proved that lambda calculus is equivalent to a Turing machine. It can do all the same things an imperative programming language can. How, then, can we achieve the same results?
It turns out that functional programs can keep state, except they don't use variables to do it. They use functions instead. The state is kept in function parameters, on the stack. If you want to keep state for a while and every now and then modify it, you write a recursive function. As an example, let's write a function that reverses a Java string. Remember, every variable we declare is final by default5.
String reverse(String arg) {
    if(arg.length == 0) {
        return arg;
    }
    else {
        return reverse(arg.substring(1, arg.length)) + arg.substring(0, 1);
    }
}
This function is slow because it repeatedly calls itself6. It's a memory hog because it repeatedly allocates objects. But it's functional in style. You may be interested why someone would want to program in this manner. Well, I was just about to tell you.

Benefits of FP
You're probably thinking that there's no way I can rationalize the monstrosity of a function above. When I was learning functional programming I was thinking that too. I was wrong. There are very good arguments for using this style. Some of them are subjective. For example, people claim that functional programs are easier to understand. I will leave out these arguments because every kid on the block knows that ease of understanding is in the eye of the beholder. Fortunately for me, there are plenty of objective arguments.
Unit Testing
Since every symbol in FP is final, no function can ever cause side effects. You can never modify things in place, nor can one function modify a value outside of its scope for another function to use (like a class member or a global variable). That means that the only effect of evaluating a function is its return value and the only thing that affects the return value of a function is its arguments.
This is a unit tester's wet dream. You can test every function in your program only worrying about its arguments. You don't have to worry about calling functions in the right order, or setting up external state properly. All you need to do is pass arguments that represent edge cases. If every function in your program passes unit tests you can be a lot more confident about quality of your software than if you were using an imperative language. In Java or C++ checking a return value of a function is not sufficient - it may modify external state that we would need to verify. Not so in a functional language.
Debugging
If a functional program doesn't behave the way you expect it to, debugging it is a breeze. You will always be able to reproduce your problem because a bug in a functional program doesn't depend on unrelated code paths that were executed before it. In an imperative program a bug resurfaces only some of the time. Because functions depend on external state produced by side effects from other functions you may have to go through a series of steps in no way related to the bug. In a functional program this isn't the case - if a return value of a function is wrong, it is always wrong, regardless of what code you execute before running the function.
Once you reproduce the problem, getting to the bottom of it is trivial. It is almost pleasant. You break the execution of your program and examine the stack. Every argument in every function call in the stack is available for your inspection, just like in an imperative program. Except in an imperative program that's not enough because functions depend on member variables, global variables, and the state of other classes (which in turn depend on these very same things). A function in a functional program depends only on its arguments, and that information is right before your eyes! Furthermore, in an imperative program examining a return value of a function will not give you a good idea of whether the function behaves properly. You need to hunt down dozens of objects outside its scope to verify that it performed correct actions. In a functional program all you have to do is look at the return value!
Walking through the stack you look at arguments passed to functions and their return values. The minute a return value doesn't make sense you step into the offending function and walk through it. You repeat this recursively until the process leads you to the source of the bug!
Concurrency
A functional program is ready for concurrency without any further modifications. You never have to worry about deadlocks and race conditions because you don't need to use locks! No piece of data in a functional program is modified twice by the same thread, let alone by two different threads. That means you can easily add threads without ever giving conventional problems that plague concurrency applications a second thought!
If this is the case, why doesn't anybody use functional programs for highly concurrent applications? Well, it turns out that they do. Ericsson designed a functional language called Erlang for use in its highly tolerant and scalable telecommunication switches. Many others recognized the benefits provided by Erlang and started using it. We're talking about telecommunication and traffic control systems that are far more scalable and reliable than typical systems designed on Wall Street. Actually, Erlang systems are not scalable and reliable. Java systems are. Erlang systems are simply rock solid.
The concurrency story doesn't stop here. If your application is inherently single threaded the compiler can still optimize functional programs to run on multiple CPUs. Take a look at the following code fragment:
String s1 = somewhatLongOperation1();
String s2 = somewhatLongOperation2();
String s3 = concatenate(s1, s2);
In a functional language the compiler could analyze the code, classify the functions that create strings s1 and s2 as potentially time consuming operations, and run them concurrently. This is impossible to do in an imperative language because each function may modify state outside of its scope and the function following it may depend on it. In functional languages automatic analysis of functions and finding good candidates for concurrent execution is as trivial as automatic inlining! In this sense functional style programs are "future proof" (as much as I hate buzzwords, I'll indulge this time). Hardware manufacturers can no longer make CPUs run any faster. Instead they increase the number of cores and attribute quadruple speed increases to concurrency. Of course they conveniently forget to mention that we get our money's worth only on software that deals with parallelizable problems. This is a very small fraction of imperative software but 100% of functional software because functional programs are all parallelizable out of the box.

www (GITHUB)
www nedir, world wide web nedir 
World Wide Web, Dünya Çapında Ağ (kısaca WWW veya Web), İnternet üzerinde yayınlanan birbirleriyle bağlantılı hiper-metin dokümanlarından oluşan bir bilgi sistemidir. Bu dokümanların her birine Web sayfası adı verilir ve Web sayfalarına İnternet kullanıcısının bilgisayarında çalışan Web tarayıcısı adı verilen bilgisayar programları aracılığıyla erişilir. Web sayfalarında metin, imaj, video ve diğer multimedya ögeleri bulunabilir ve diğer bağlantı ya da link adı verilen hiper-bağlantılar ile başka Web sayfalarına geçiş yapılabilir.

İnternet ve Web terimleri aynı olguyu tanımlamaz. Zira Web sadece İnternet üzerinde çalışan bir servistir. Web kavramı, CERN'de bir bilgisayar programcısı olan Tim Berners-Lee'nin HTML adlı metin işaretleme dilini geliştirmesiyle oluşmuştur. Bugün de kendisinin başkanı olduğu W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) tarafından standartları belirlenmektedir.

Yapısı
Web’in temeli İnternet'tir. Web İnternet üzerinde kurulmuştur ve İnternet'in sunduğu mekanizmalardan çoğunun kullanılmasını sağlar. İnternet'in fiziksel görünüşleri –bilgisayarlar, ağlar ve servisler– Dünya üzerindeki diğer binlerce bilgisayara bağlanmamıza izin verir. Web, İnternet'in en tepesindeki soyutlanmış genel servisler kümesidir. World Wide Web (W3), insanların fikir ve projelerinin paylaşılmasını sağlayan bir bilgi ve kültür havuzudur. İstemci-sunucu uygulamaları ile yapılan birçok organizasyon üzerinde Web tarayıcıları istemci olarak çalışabilirler. Web yürütümü standart İstemci-sunucu modelini izler. Aşağıdaki şekilde gösterildiği gibi "Web tarayıcısı" adı verilen programı çalıştıran bir istemci bilgisayar ile Web sunucu yazılımı çalıştıran bir sunucu bilgisayar arasındaki etkileşime "istemci-sunucu" etkileşimi adı verilir. İstemci bilgisayar sunucudan HTTP'yi (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) ve İnternet mesaj standardı TCP/IP'yi kullanarak bir doküman ister ve sunucu istemcinin göstereceği dokümanı geri döndürür.-

Alias vs .NET Type	(GITHUB) (asasas)
The predefined data types are alias to their .NET type (CLR class) name. The following table lists alias for predefined data types and related .NET class name.

Byte int falan STRUCT type’mış… Class değilmiş….

 
It means that whether you define a variable of int or Int32, both are the same.
int i = 345;
Int32 i = 345;// same as above 

Default Values
Every data type has a default value. Numeric type is 0, boolean has false, and char has '\0' as default value. Use the default(typename) to assign a default value of the data type or C# 7.1 onward, use default literal.
int i = default(int); // 0
float f = default(float);// 0
decimal d = default(decimal);// 0
bool b = default(bool);// false
char c = default(char);// '\0'

// C# 7.1 onwards
int i = default; // 0
float f = default;// 0
decimal d = default;// 0
bool b = default;// false
char c = default;// '\0'

Conversions
The values of certain data types are automatically converted to different data types in C#. This is called an implicit conversion.
Example: Implicit Conversion
int i = 345;
float f = i;

Console.WriteLine(f); //output: 345
